# High Output Management

> Think like Intel's legendary CEO. Apply Andy Grove's management operating system to maximize your team's output through leverage, OKRs, and systematic decision-making.

## When to Use This Skill

- **Scaling a team** when individual contribution isn't enough
- **Performance management** to measure and improve output
- **Meeting optimization** to make meetings productive
- **Decision-making** in management contexts
- **New manager transition** from individual contributor
- **Organizational design** for efficiency

## Methodology Foundation

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Source** | Andy Grove - High Output Management (1983) |
| **Core Principle** | "A manager's output = Output of their organization + Output of neighboring organizations under their influence." |
| **Why This Matters** | Management is a skill, not just a title. Grove's engineering approach to management created modern tech management practices, including OKRs (used by Google, Intel, LinkedIn, etc.). |


## What Claude Does vs What You Decide

| Claude Does | You Decide |
|-------------|------------|
| Structures analysis frameworks | Strategic priorities |
| Synthesizes market data | Competitive positioning |
| Identifies opportunities | Resource allocation |
| Creates strategic options | Final strategy selection |
| Suggests implementation approaches | Execution decisions |

## What This Skill Does

1. **Defines management as output** - Measurable, not abstract
2. **Teaches leverage** - Maximize output per unit of management time
3. **Structures 1:1s and meetings** - For information gathering and decision-making
4. **Introduces OKRs** - Objectives and Key Results framework
5. **Builds management rhythm** - Systematic operating cadence
6. **Improves performance management** - Task-relevant maturity

## How to Use

### Design Your Management System
```
I'm managing a team of [X] people doing [type of work].
Help me design a Grove-style management operating system.
```

### Improve Your Leverage
```
I'm spending my time on [activities].
Apply High Output Management thinking to improve my leverage.
```

### Set Up OKRs
```
Help me create OKRs for [team/individual/company].
Context: [current goals, challenges]
```

## Instructions

### Step 1: Understand Management as Production

```
## The Production Principle

### Grove's Key Insight

Management isn't about status or authority.
Management is about OUTPUT.

**A manager's output =**
Output of their team +
Output of other teams they influence

### The Factory Analogy

Think of your team as a production line:
- Raw materials → Work in progress → Finished goods
- Input → Process → Output

**Your job:**
1. Identify limiting steps
2. Remove bottlenecks
3. Increase throughput
4. Maintain quality

### Manager Activities

Everything you do falls into three categories:

**1. Information gathering**
- 1:1s
- Staff meetings
- Reports
- Walking around

**2. Information giving**
- Direction setting
- Teaching
- Decisions communicated
- Feedback

**3. Decision-making**
- Prioritization
- Resource allocation
- Hiring/firing
- Process design

### The Leverage Equation

**Leverage = Output / Activity**

High leverage activities:
- Training (multiplies across many people)
- Decisions (unlock blocked work)
- Systems (automate repeated work)

Low leverage activities:
- Doing work others could do
- Meetings without decisions
- Reviewing what's already done well
```

---

### Step 2: Master Management Leverage

```
## Types of Leverage

### High Leverage Activities

**1. Training**
An hour spent training 10 people = 10 hours of improved output.
Training has the highest ROI of any management activity.

**Questions:**
- Who on my team could I train?
- What knowledge do I have that would help them?
- How can I systematize training?

**2. Decisions that unblock work**
When your decision is the bottleneck, make it.
Delayed decisions multiply delays.

**Questions:**
- What decisions are people waiting on?
- Which decisions must be mine vs. delegated?
- How fast am I making decisions?

**3. Motivation and recognition**
Peak performance requires motivation, not just direction.
Recognition costs you nothing but drives output.

**Questions:**
- Who deserves recognition this week?
- What motivates each person on my team?
- Am I providing meaning, not just tasks?

### Low Leverage Traps

**1. Doing work yourself**
If someone else can do it 70% as well, delegate.
Your job is enabling output, not doing output.

**2. Attending meetings you don't need**
Every meeting is time not doing high-leverage work.
Audit: "Would this meeting happen without me?"

**3. Over-reviewing work**
Review is valuable. Over-review is micromanagement.
Match review depth to risk and skill level.

### The Meddling Trap

**Signs you're meddling:**
- Making decisions your team should make
- Reviewing work that doesn't need review
- Being in every meeting
- People wait for your approval on everything

**The fix:**
Delegate. Then don't take it back.
```

---

### Step 3: Run Effective Meetings

```
## Grove on Meetings

### Two Types of Meetings

**Process-oriented meetings (Regular)**
- 1:1s
- Staff meetings
- Operations reviews

Purpose: Information flow, coordination, rhythm

**Mission-oriented meetings (Ad hoc)**
- Decisions needed
- Problems to solve
- Opportunities to evaluate

Purpose: Make a decision, then disband

### The 1:1

**Purpose:**
- Information exchange (both ways)
- Mutual teaching and coaching
- Problem surfacing
- Relationship building

**Frequency:**
Depends on task-relevant maturity (more often for newer/struggling people).
Weekly is baseline. Bi-weekly for senior/independent people.

**Agenda:**
Report's agenda, not manager's.
Manager asks questions, doesn't lecture.

**Structure:**
1. Report shares what's going well
2. Report shares challenges/blockers
3. Manager asks clarifying questions
4. Discussion of development/priorities
5. Manager shares relevant context

**Key principle:**
The 1:1 is their meeting, not yours.

### Staff Meetings

**Purpose:**
- Cross-team information sharing
- Peer-level problem solving
- Coordination decisions

**What doesn't belong:**
- Reporting what could be read
- Manager lecturing
- Decisions without the right people

**Facilitation:**
Manager as facilitator, not star.
"What does the group think?"

### Operations Reviews

**Purpose:**
- Present to senior management
- Teaching tool (everyone learns)
- Accountability mechanism

**Format:**
Formal presentation + Q&A
Monthly or quarterly

### Decision Meetings

**Purpose:**
Make a specific decision

**Requirements:**
- Clear decision to be made
- Right people in the room
- Data/options prepared
- End with decision + owner

**Rule:**
If you didn't make a decision, the meeting failed.
```

### Step 4: Implement OKRs

```
## Objectives and Key Results

### Origin

Andy Grove invented OKRs at Intel.
John Doerr brought them to Google.
Now used by thousands of companies.

### The Framework

**Objective:**
What do we want to achieve?
- Qualitative
- Inspirational
- Time-bound (usually quarterly)

**Key Results:**
How will we know we achieved it?
- Quantitative
- Measurable
- 3-5 per objective

### Good OKRs

**Objective:** Become the preferred CRM for mid-market companies

**Key Results:**
1. Increase NPS from 42 to 55
2. Grow mid-market ARR from $5M to $8M
3. Reduce mid-market churn from 8% to 5%
4. Launch 3 features identified by mid-market research

### Bad OKRs

**Objective:** Improve the product

**Key Results:**
1. Ship features
2. Fix bugs
3. Make customers happy

**Problems:**
- Objective is vague
- Key results aren't measurable
- No targets to aim for

### OKR Principles

**1. Cascading alignment**
Company OKRs → Team OKRs → Individual OKRs
Each level supports the level above.

**2. Stretch goals**
70% achievement = success
100% = you aimed too low
If you always hit OKRs, they're not ambitious enough.

**3. Public and transparent**
Everyone can see everyone's OKRs.
Creates alignment and accountability.

**4. Separate from compensation**
OKRs are for focus and alignment.
Don't tie to bonuses (creates sandbagging).

### OKR Cadence

**Quarterly:**
- Set new OKRs at quarter start
- Review at quarter end
- Score (0.0 to 1.0)

**Weekly:**
- Check in on key results
- Adjust activities
- Surface blockers

**Never:**
- Change OKRs mid-quarter (unless massive shift)
- Let OKRs become task lists
- Forget to review
```

---

### Step 5: Task-Relevant Maturity

```
## Matching Management to Maturity

### The Framework

**Task-Relevant Maturity (TRM):**
How experienced/capable is this person at THIS specific task?

Note: Not overall experience. Task-specific.

### TRM Levels and Management Style

**Low TRM:**
- New to task
- Uncertain, needs guidance
- Might fail without support

**Management style:** Structured
- Clear instructions
- Defined process
- Frequent check-ins
- More directive

**Medium TRM:**
- Some experience
- Can do basics independently
- Needs coaching for advanced

**Management style:** Coaching
- Ask more than tell
- Check results, not process
- Problem-solve together
- Guide decisions

**High TRM:**
- Expert at this task
- Knows more than you might
- Self-directed

**Management style:** Delegation
- Set objectives, let them run
- Infrequent check-ins
- Available when needed
- Trust their judgment

### The Matching Principle

**Wrong match = Problems:**

High TRM + Directive = Demotivation
"You're micromanaging me!"

Low TRM + Delegation = Failure
"I didn't know what I was doing and no one helped."

### TRM Is Task-Specific

**Example:**
A senior engineer (High TRM at coding) who becomes a manager
is Low TRM at management. Manage them accordingly.

**Reassess when:**
- New tasks/responsibilities
- New environment
- Declining performance
- Explicit request for support
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Management Operating System Design

**Input:**
> "I manage a team of 8 engineers. I feel like I'm in meetings all day and not adding value. Help me design a Grove-style management system."

**Output:**

## Management Operating System: Engineering Team

### Current State Analysis

**8 direct reports = Full management load**

Grove recommends 6-8 direct reports maximum.
You're at capacity. Focus on leverage.

### Weekly Rhythm

| Day | AM | PM |
|-----|----|----|
| Monday | 1:1s (2) | Team Planning |
| Tuesday | 1:1s (2) | Focus Time |
| Wednesday | 1:1s (2) | Cross-Team Sync |
| Thursday | 1:1s (2) | Focus Time |
| Friday | Staff Meeting | Decision Time |

**Total 1:1 time:** 4-8 hours/week (30-60 min each)
**Total meeting time:** ~12 hours/week
**Focus/leverage time:** ~20 hours/week

### Meeting Structure

**1:1s (30-60 min each)**

```
Template:
1. How are you doing? (5 min)
   - Energy, mood, blockers

2. What did you accomplish? (10 min)
   - Celebrate wins
   - Surface issues early

3. What's challenging? (15 min)
   - Blocker removal
   - Coaching opportunities

4. What's next? (10 min)
   - Priorities aligned
   - Support needed

5. Anything else? (5 min)
   - Open floor
```

**Staff Meeting (Friday, 60 min)**

```
Agenda:
1. Announcements (5 min)
   - Company updates, logistics

2. Metrics review (10 min)
   - Key team metrics
   - Trends, anomalies

3. Around the horn (20 min)
   - Each person: 2 min
   - What's going well, what's stuck

4. Discussion topic (20 min)
   - One deep dive
   - Rotating owner each week

5. Decisions needed (5 min)
   - Quick decisions or schedule decision meeting
```

### Leverage Analysis

**High Leverage Activities (Increase these):**

| Activity | Current | Target | How |
|----------|---------|--------|-----|
| Training/coaching | 2 hr/wk | 5 hr/wk | Add 30 min to each 1:1 for skill building |
| Decision-making | Reactive | Proactive | Schedule "Decision Time" Friday PM |
| System building | 0 hr/wk | 3 hr/wk | One system improvement per week |

**Low Leverage Activities (Reduce these):**

| Activity | Current | Action |
|----------|---------|--------|
| Status meetings | 4 hr/wk | Async updates, meeting only for discussion |
| Code review | 5 hr/wk | Reduce to critical PRs only |
| Attending meetings | Many | Ask: "Do they need me?" |

- Weekly sales sync

### OKR Tracking Cadence

**Weekly:**
- Update key result progress
- Identify blockers
- Adjust activities (not OKRs)

**Monthly:**
- OKR review in staff meeting
- Score progress (0.0-1.0)
- Course correct

**End of Quarter:**
- Final scoring
- Retrospective
- Input to next quarter OKRs

### OKR Scoring Guide

| Score | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 0.0-0.3 | Failed to make progress |
| 0.4-0.6 | Progress but fell short |
| 0.7-0.9 | Strong delivery |
| 1.0 | Fully achieved (maybe too easy?) |

**Target:** Average 0.7 across OKRs

---

### Example 3: Task-Relevant Maturity Assessment

**Input:**
> "I have a team member who's been an engineer for 5 years but just got promoted to tech lead. How do I manage them?"

**Output:**

## TRM Assessment: New Tech Lead

### Analysis

**Overall experience:** High (5 years engineering)
**Task-relevant maturity for leadership:** Low

**Why Low TRM for leadership:**
- First time leading
- Different skills required
- New failure modes
- New stakeholder relationships

### Recommended Management Approach

**Phase 1: First 30 Days - Structured Support**

| Activity | Frequency | Purpose |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| 1:1s | 2x/week | Close monitoring |
| Check-ins | Daily | Surface problems early |
| Shadowing | Key meetings | Teach by example |

**Coaching focus:**
- How to run 1:1s with their team
- How to give feedback
- How to delegate effectively
- How to communicate up

**Explicit guidance:**
"For the first month, I want you to tell me before you make these decisions: [list]. Not because I don't trust you, but because I want to help you learn the judgment behind them."

**Phase 2: Days 30-90 - Coaching Mode**

| Activity | Frequency | Purpose |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| 1:1s | Weekly | Reflection and learning |
| Check-ins | 2x/week | Lighter touch |
| Debrief | After key situations | Extract learnings |

**Coaching focus:**
- "What did you try? What happened?"
- "What would you do differently?"
- "What's your read on [situation]?"

**Gradually:**
- Remove decision approval requirements
- Ask more questions, give less direction
- Celebrate growing independence

**Phase 3: Day 90+ - Delegation Mode**

| Activity | Frequency | Purpose |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| 1:1s | Weekly or bi-weekly | Partnership |
| Check-ins | As needed | Available when called |

**By now:**
- They're making most decisions independently
- They come to you for advice, not approval
- They're developing their own team

### Warning Signs to Watch

**Struggling (intervene):**
- Team complaining about lack of direction
- Decisions being avoided
- Burnout signs
- Reverting to IC work

**Thriving (celebrate):**
- Team is productive
- Confident in decisions
- Seeking new challenges
- Developing others

### The Transition Conversation

"[Name], you've been a strong engineer, and I'm excited about your move to tech lead. I want to be clear: this is a new job with new skills.

For the first month, I'm going to be more hands-on than usual. Not because I don't trust you—because I do—but because leadership has different failure modes than engineering, and I want to set you up to succeed.

As you get more comfortable, I'll step back. My goal is for you to be running your team independently within 90 days.

What questions do you have? What are you most nervous about?"

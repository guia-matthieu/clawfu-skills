### Step 2: Define Renewal Timeline

**Standard Timeline (90-Day):**

| Days Out | Activity | Owner |
|----------|----------|-------|
| 120 | Health check, flag risks | CSM |
| 90 | Renewal kickoff | CSM |
| 75 | Value review call | CSM |
| 60 | Proposal sent | CSM/Sales |
| 45 | Negotiation | Sales |
| 30 | Final terms | Sales |
| 14 | Signature push | Sales |
| 0 | Renewal close | Sales |

### Step 3: Build Health-Based Playbooks

**Green Playbook (Healthy):**

**Yellow Playbook (Monitor):**

### Step 4: Calculate Renewal Forecast

```
Renewal Forecast =

  (Yellow × 80%) +
  (Orange × 50%) +
  (Red × 25%)
```

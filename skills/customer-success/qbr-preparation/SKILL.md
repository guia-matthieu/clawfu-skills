| Quantified ROI | "Saved X hours, $Y dollars, Z%" |
| Goals achieved | Their stated goals → our impact |
| Milestones | Major accomplishments |
| Testimonial-worthy | Quote-able successes |

**Structure:**
```
"When you started with us, you wanted to [GOAL].
In Q[X], you achieved [RESULT]."
```

### Step 3: Assess Current Health

**Health Dashboard:**
```
| Dimension | Score | Trend | Notes |
|-----------|-------|-------|-------|
| Product | X/25 | ↗️↘️→ | Key metric |
| Support | X/25 | ↗️↘️→ | CSAT, tickets |
| Financial | X/25 | ↗️↘️→ | Payment, growth |
| Relationship | X/25 | ↗️↘️→ | Engagement |

```

### Step 4: Identify Risks and Opportunities

**Risk Assessment:**
| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| [Risk] | H/M/L | H/M/L | [Action] |

**Opportunity Assessment:**

|-------------|-------|----------|-----------|
| [Opp] | $X | Q1/Q2 | [Action] |

### Step 5: Develop Recommendations

**Strategic Recommendations Framework:**
1. **Continue** - What's working, keep doing
2. **Start** - New initiatives for next quarter
3. **Stop** - What should we change or deprioritize

## 📝 Talking Points

### Opening
"Sarah, before we dive in, I want to acknowledge the incredible progress your team has made. A 35% reduction in downtime is exceptional—most customers see 20-25% in their first year."

### Competitive Defense (if needed)
"I heard [Competitor] came by. Happy to do a side-by-side comparison, but I'd also point out: you've already achieved ROI with us. Switching has real costs—time, retraining, risk. Let's talk about what's driving the evaluation."

### Budget Concern
"You mentioned budget reviews coming up. Would it help if I prepared a one-page ROI summary your team could use internally? The 35% downtime number plus the $220K in savings is a strong story."

### Expansion Ask
"With two new plants opening, I want to make sure we're ahead of the curve. What's the timeline? We could do a phased rollout to minimize disruption."

### Executive Engagement
"I'd love to get Mike more involved. Would it make sense to schedule a brief executive update—maybe 20 minutes—where we share the ROI story and get his input on strategic priorities?"

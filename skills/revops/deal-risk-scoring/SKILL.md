## Deal Risk Assessment: TechCorp Global

### Overall Score: 28/100 🔴 RED - HIGH RISK

### Score Breakdown

| Factor | Score | Issues |
|--------|-------|--------|
| Engagement | 0/25 | No response in 14+ days |
| Stakeholders | 5/25 | Single-threaded, no EB |
| Process | 5/25 | Pushed once, no clear next step |
| Competition | 18/25 | Competitor known but not blocking |
| **Total** | **28/100** | |

### Critical Risks

1. **🔴 Champion Gone Dark** - John hasn't responded in 14 days
   - Possible: Left company, lost internal support, chose competitor

2. **🔴 Single-Threaded** - No other relationships
   - If John is out, deal is dead

3. **🟠 No Economic Buyer** - Never met decision maker
   - John may not have authority to close

### Recommended Actions

**This Week:**
1. Research John on LinkedIn - still at company?
2. Find another contact via LinkedIn/referral
3. Send "breakup email" to force response
4. Check if Competitor X is in active eval

**If No Response by Friday:**
- Move to Stage 2 or Closed-Lost
- Free up forecast slot

### Red Flags to Watch
- If proposal was forwarded to competitor
- If budget was reallocated
- If project was deprioritized

### Save Probability: 25%
Without new contact access, this deal is likely lost.

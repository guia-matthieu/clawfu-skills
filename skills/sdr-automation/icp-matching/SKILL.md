**Technographic Criteria:**
| Attribute | Ideal | Acceptable | Disqualify |
|-----------|-------|------------|------------|

### Step 2: Weight and Score

**Scoring Model:**

| <40 | Poor | Disqualify |

### Step 3: Apply to Prospects

For each prospect:
1. Gather available data
2. Score each dimension
3. Calculate weighted score
4. Classify and prioritize

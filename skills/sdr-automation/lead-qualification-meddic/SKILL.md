## What Claude Does vs What You Decide

| Claude Does | You Decide |
|-------------|------------|

| Scores each component | Resource investment |
| Identifies gaps | Coaching focus |
| Creates deal summaries | Forecast commit |
| Suggests next actions | Win strategy |

## Instructions

### Step 1: Define MEDDIC Components

| Component | Definition | Key Question |
|-----------|------------|--------------|
| **Metrics** | Quantified outcomes | "What numbers will improve?" |
| **Economic Buyer** | Person with budget authority | "Who can say yes and write the check?" |
| **Decision Criteria** | How they evaluate | "What criteria will you use to decide?" |
| **Decision Process** | Steps to purchase | "What happens between now and signed contract?" |
| **Identify Pain** | Business problem | "What happens if this doesn't get solved?" |
| **Champion** | Internal advocate | "Who's fighting for this internally?" |
| **Competition** | Alternatives | "What else are you considering?" |
| **Paper Process** | Procurement/legal | "What's involved in getting contracts signed?" |

### Step 2: Discovery Questions by Component

**Metrics:**
- "If this project succeeds, what numbers will change?"
- "How will you measure ROI?"
- "What's the cost of the current problem?"
- "What KPIs are you trying to impact?"

**Economic Buyer:**
- "Who ultimately approves the budget for this?"
- "Have you worked with them on similar initiatives?"
- "Can I meet them before we finalize a proposal?"

**Decision Criteria:**
- "What are the must-haves vs nice-to-haves?"
- "How will you compare solutions?"
- "Who developed these criteria?"
- "How important is [your differentiator]?"

**Decision Process:**
- "Walk me through the steps from here to signed contract."
- "Who else needs to evaluate this?"
- "Are there approval committees or board reviews?"
- "What could delay or derail this process?"

**Identify Pain:**
- "What's driving this initiative now?"
- "What happens if you do nothing?"
- "How is this affecting your team/business/customers?"
- "Have you tried to solve this before?"

**Champion:**
- "Who's the biggest advocate for this project?"
- "What happens to them if this succeeds/fails?"
- "Can they get us access to [stakeholder]?"
- "How much influence do they have?"

**Competition:**
- "What alternatives are you considering?"
- "How far along are you with other vendors?"
- "What do you like about what you've seen?"
- "How does that compare to what we've shown you?"

**Paper Process:**
- "What's your typical procurement timeline?"
- "Are there security or legal reviews required?"
- "Have you worked with vendors like us before?"
- "What can we do to expedite the process?"

### Step 3: Score Each Component

| Score | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| 🟢 3 | Confirmed, documented, verified |
| 🟡 2 | Identified but not confirmed |

**Deal Qualification Levels:**
| Score | Status | Action |
|-------|--------|--------|
| 21-24 | Strong | Commit to forecast |
| 16-20 | Developing | Address gaps |
| 11-15 | Early | More discovery needed |

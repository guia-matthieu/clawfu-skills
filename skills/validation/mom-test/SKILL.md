# The Mom Test

> Extract honest customer insights by asking questions about their life instead of your idea. Master Rob Fitzpatrick's methodology for conversations that can't lie to you.

## When to Use This Skill

- **Before building anything** to validate if the problem is real and painful
- **Customer discovery calls** to get honest feedback without leading questions
- **Pivoting decisions** to understand if you should change direction
- **Feature prioritization** to learn what customers actually need vs. say they want
- **Pricing conversations** to discover willingness to pay without asking directly
- **Early sales conversations** to qualify leads without pitching

## Methodology Foundation

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Source** | Rob Fitzpatrick - "The Mom Test" (2013) |
| **Core Principle** | "Talk about their life instead of your idea. Ask about specifics in the past instead of generics or opinions about the future." |
| **Why This Matters** | People lie to be polite. Even your mom will say your idea is great. But they can't lie about what they've already done, what problems hurt them, and how they've tried to solve them. |


## What Claude Does vs What You Decide

| Claude Does | You Decide |
|-------------|------------|
| Structures production workflow | Final creative direction |
| Suggests technical approaches | Equipment and tool choices |
| Creates templates and checklists | Quality standards |
| Identifies best practices | Brand/voice decisions |
| Generates script outlines | Final script approval |

## What This Skill Does

1. **Generates non-leading questions** - Questions that can't be answered with polite lies
2. **Identifies commitment signals** - Distinguishes real interest from fake enthusiasm
3. **Extracts problem severity** - Finds out if problems are bad enough to pay to solve
4. **Uncovers existing solutions** - Discovers what people already use/do
5. **Validates willingness to pay** - Tests pricing without asking "would you pay?"

## How to Use

### Validate a Business Idea
```
I want to validate my idea: [describe idea]
Use The Mom Test to generate questions I should ask potential customers.
Focus on understanding their current problems, not pitching my solution.
```

### Prepare for Customer Interviews
```
I have customer calls scheduled with [type of customer].
Generate a Mom Test interview script to validate [specific hypothesis].
Include follow-up questions and commitment asks.
```

### Analyze Interview Responses
```
Here are notes from my customer interview: [paste notes]
Analyze them using Mom Test principles:
- What did I learn that's actually valid?
- Where did I lead the witness?
- What commitment signals (or lack of) did I see?
```

## Instructions

When helping with customer discovery conversations, follow The Mom Test methodology:

### Step 1: Understand the Three Rules

```
## The Mom Test: 3 Rules

1. **Talk about THEIR life, not YOUR idea**
   - Bad: "Would you use an app that..."
   - Good: "How do you currently handle..."

2. **Ask about SPECIFICS in the PAST, not generics about the FUTURE**
   - Bad: "Would you pay for...?"
   - Good: "Last time this happened, what did you do?"

3. **Talk less, listen more**
   - Bad: Explaining your solution for 10 minutes
   - Good: "Tell me more about that..."
```

**The Name:** It's called "The Mom Test" because even your mom can't lie to you if you ask good questions. She can lie about your idea ("That sounds great, honey!"). She can't lie about her own behavior ("Last week I spent 3 hours doing X").

---

### Step 2: Generate Questions That Pass The Mom Test

```
## Question Transformation

### Questions About the PROBLEM (not your solution)

FAILING THE MOM TEST:
- "Would you use a product that does X?"
- "Do you think X is a good idea?"
- "Would you pay $Y for this?"
- "What features would you want?"

PASSING THE MOM TEST:
- "Tell me about the last time you dealt with [problem]..."
- "What's the hardest part about [task]?"
- "How are you currently solving [problem]?"
- "What have you already tried?"
- "How much does this problem cost you?" (time, money, frustration)
- "Why haven't you solved this already?"

### Questions About their BEHAVIOR (not opinions)

FAILING:
- "How often would you use this?"
- "Would your friends use this?"

PASSING:
- "How often did this happen last month?"
- "Who else deals with this? Can you introduce me?"
- "What did you do last time this happened?"
```

**Key insight:** Opinions are worthless. Behavior is gold. "I would definitely use that" = worthless. "I spent 3 hours last week doing this manually" = gold.

---

### Step 3: Structure the Conversation

```
## Mom Test Conversation Flow

### OPENING (2 min)
"Thanks for chatting. I'm trying to understand how [target people]
handle [general area]. Mind sharing how you deal with it?"

### PROBLEM EXPLORATION (10-15 min)
1. "Tell me about the last time you [relevant situation]..."
2. "What was the hardest part about that?"
3. "Why was that hard?" (dig deeper)
4. "How did you end up handling it?"
5. "What else have you tried?"
6. "How much time/money does this cost you?"

### EXISTING SOLUTIONS (5 min)
1. "What are you using today to handle this?"
2. "What do you love about it?"
3. "What's frustrating about it?"
4. "Have you looked for alternatives?"

### COMMITMENT & ADVANCEMENT (5 min)
1. "If you had a magic wand solution, what would it do?"
2. "What would make this worth paying for?"
3. "Who else should I talk to about this?"
4. "Would you be willing to try an early version?"

### CLOSE
"This was really helpful. One more thing - if I built something
to solve this, would you want to see it?"
```

---

### Step 4: Look for Commitment Signals

```
## Commitment Escalation Ladder

### WEAK SIGNALS (Don't trust these)
- "That sounds cool"
- "I'd definitely use that"
- "Send me an email when you launch"
- "Yeah, that's a problem for me"

### MEDIUM SIGNALS (Getting warmer)
- Giving you their calendar time
- Introducing you to colleagues/friends
- Signing up for a beta waitlist
- Asking detailed questions about pricing/timeline

### STRONG SIGNALS (Real validation)
- Letter of intent to purchase
- Prepayment or deposit
- Doing real work (filling out forms, moving data)
- Introducing you to budget holder
- Asking "When can I have it?"

### STRONGEST SIGNAL
- They're trying to give you money NOW
```

**Rule:** If they don't commit something (time, reputation, money), they're not a real customer. Compliments are not commitments.

---

### Step 5: Analyze What You Learned

```
## Post-Interview Analysis

### FILTER OUT FALSE SIGNALS

**Discard:**
- Hypotheticals ("I would...")
- Future predictions ("I'll definitely...")
- Compliments ("That's a great idea")
- Generic positivity ("People will love this")

**Keep:**
- Specific stories from the past
- Actual numbers (time, money, frequency)
- Emotional language about problems
- Commitment actions taken

### EXTRACT REAL INSIGHTS

| Question | Their Answer | Is This Valid? | Why? |
|----------|--------------|----------------|------|
| [Q1] | [Answer] | Yes/No | [Past/Future, Specific/Generic] |
| [Q2] | [Answer] | Yes/No | [Past/Future, Specific/Generic] |

### RED FLAGS

- [ ] They were being polite
- [ ] They talked about what they "would" do (future)
- [ ] They didn't give specific examples
- [ ] No commitment was made
- [ ] I did more than 30% of the talking
- [ ] I mentioned my solution before understanding their problem
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Validating a Meal Planning App

**Context:** Founder wants to build a meal planning app for busy families. Meeting with working mom.

**Input:**
> "I want to validate my meal planning app idea with busy parents. Generate Mom Test questions."

**Output:**

**Questions That FAIL The Mom Test:**
- ~~"Would you use a meal planning app?"~~
- ~~"How much would you pay for meal planning?"~~
- ~~"Do you think this is a good idea?"~~

**Questions That PASS The Mom Test:**

**Problem Exploration:**
1. "Walk me through what happened last Tuesday night around dinner time."
2. "How did you decide what to make?"
3. "What was the most stressful dinner night you had last month?"
4. "When's the last time you threw away food that went bad?"

**Current Behavior:**
5. "How do you currently plan what to eat for the week?"
6. "What apps or tools are you using today for anything food-related?"
7. "How often do you end up ordering takeout when you hadn't planned to?"
8. "Last time you looked for a solution to this, what happened?"

**Severity & Willingness:**
9. "How much money would you guess you waste monthly on food you don't eat?"
10. "If you had an extra hour each week, what would you do with it?"
11. "What have you tried in the past to fix this?"
12. "Why didn't those solutions stick?"

**Commitment Test:**
13. "I'm interviewing parents about this - who else should I talk to?"
14. "Would you be willing to spend 15 minutes testing something in a few weeks?"
15. "If I could get you back 2 hours a week, what would that be worth to you?"

**Why This Works:** These questions uncover actual pain (wasted food, stressful dinners, time spent planning), current behavior (what they already do), and commitment (will they take action?).

### Example 2: B2B SaaS - Sales Team Tool

**Context:** Founder building a sales enablement tool. Talking to VP Sales.

**Input:**
> "Validate my sales enablement tool with this VP Sales. Here are my notes from the call - analyze them using Mom Test principles."

**Interview Notes:**
```
Me: We're building a tool that helps sales teams close deals faster.
Would that be useful?
VP: Definitely, our sales cycles are too long.

Me: How long are they?
VP: Usually 3-6 months.

Me: Would you pay $500/month to cut that in half?
VP: Probably, yeah. Sounds reasonable.

Me: Great, what features would be most important?
VP: Probably better tracking and automation.

Me: Can I follow up next week?
VP: Sure, send me an email.
```

**Output:**

**Mom Test Analysis: FAILED**

| Question | Valid? | Problem |
|----------|--------|---------|
| "Would that be useful?" | NO | Leading, hypothetical |
| "Would you pay $500/month?" | NO | Hypothetical, no commitment |
| "What features would be most important?" | NO | Opinions, not behavior |

**What We Actually Learned:** Almost nothing. "Probably" and "sounds reasonable" are polite brush-offs.

**Red Flags:**
- No specific stories from the past
- No emotional language about problems
- No commitment beyond "send me an email"
- You mentioned your solution first
- All answers were vague and polite

**How To Fix - Better Questions:**

1. "Tell me about your last deal that took way longer than expected. What happened?"
2. "What did you try to speed it up?"
3. "How much revenue do you think you lost in Q4 from slow-moving deals?"
4. "What tools are your reps using today? Show me your workflow."
5. "What happened the last time you tried to fix this?"
6. "What's the most you've ever paid for a sales tool? Was it worth it?"

**Better Commitment Ask:**
- "I'd love to shadow one of your reps for an hour to understand their workflow. When works?"
- "Would you be willing to pilot this with 3 reps if I built it?"
- "Can you intro me to two other VPs dealing with this?"

---

### Example 3: Validating Pricing (Without Asking About Price)

**Context:** Founder has validated the problem, now needs to validate willingness to pay.

**Input:**
> "I know the problem is real. How do I validate pricing using Mom Test principles? I don't want to ask 'would you pay X?'"

**Output:**

**Why "Would You Pay $X?" Fails:**
- People say "yes" to be polite
- They can't predict their future behavior
- It's not real until they actually pay

**Mom Test Pricing Questions:**

**Past Spending Behavior:**
1. "What's the most you've ever paid for [similar product]?"
2. "How much are you spending per month on [current solution]?"
3. "What did you pay for the last tool you added to your stack?"
4. "Tell me about a purchase you regretted - what happened?"

**Budget Authority:**
5. "How do purchases like this get approved at your company?"
6. "What's the last thing under $500 you bought without approval?"
7. "Who else would need to sign off on something like this?"

**Value Framing:**
8. "You mentioned this problem costs you [X hours/dollars]. If I could cut that in half, what would that be worth?"
9. "How much would you pay to never deal with [problem] again?"
10. "What would you pay for [specific outcome]?"

**Commitment Over Price:**
11. "I'm thinking of charging around $X. If I built this, would you commit to being one of the first 10 customers?"
12. "Would you prepay $X for early access?"
13. "Can we do a paid pilot with your team?"

**Strongest Validation:**
- Letter of Intent with specific price
- Prepayment (even small)
- Purchase order in process
- "Take my credit card" (yes, this happens)

**Why This Works:** Past behavior predicts future behavior. If they've never paid for anything like this, they probably won't pay for yours. If they're spending $1,000/month on a crappy solution, they might pay $500 for a better one.

### Red Flags Checklist

```
## Warning Signs You're Getting Fake Validation

DURING THE INTERVIEW:
- [ ] They're using vague language ("sometimes", "usually", "probably")
- [ ] They're talking about the future, not the past
- [ ] They seem to be agreeing with everything
- [ ] No emotional language about the problem
- [ ] You're doing more than 30% of the talking
- [ ] They haven't asked you any questions back
- [ ] No specific stories, just generalizations

AFTER THE INTERVIEW:
- [ ] You feel great (warning: might be false positivity)
- [ ] They didn't commit to anything concrete
- [ ] You don't have a clear next step
- [ ] You can't point to specific quotes that prove your hypothesis
- [ ] Their "enthusiasm" didn't translate to action

THE FIX:
When you see these flags, stop and pivot to:
"Can you tell me about a specific time when this happened?"
"Walk me through exactly what you did..."
"What did that cost you in terms of time/money?"
```

# Never Split the Difference

> Master FBI hostage negotiation techniques adapted for business. Apply Chris Voss' proven methods to close deals, handle objections, and negotiate from a position of strength.

## When to Use This Skill

- **High-stakes negotiations** where outcomes matter significantly
- **Difficult conversations** with clients, vendors, or partners
- **Price negotiations** when you need to hold firm
- **Conflict resolution** between team members or stakeholders
- **Sales objections** that standard techniques don't resolve
- **Contract negotiations** with enterprise clients

## Methodology Foundation

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Source** | Chris Voss - Never Split the Difference (2016) |
| **Core Principle** | "Negotiation is not about winning. It's about discovering the other side's world and using that to get what you need." |
| **Why This Matters** | Traditional negotiation teaches compromise. FBI techniques show that understanding emotions and tactical empathy create better outcomes for everyone. |


## What Claude Does vs What You Decide

| Claude Does | You Decide |
|-------------|------------|
| Structures production workflow | Final creative direction |
| Suggests technical approaches | Equipment and tool choices |
| Creates templates and checklists | Quality standards |
| Identifies best practices | Brand/voice decisions |
| Generates script outlines | Final script approval |

## What This Skill Does

1. **Teaches tactical empathy** - Understanding the other side's perspective
2. **Provides labeling techniques** - Naming emotions to diffuse them
3. **Introduces calibrated questions** - "How" and "what" questions that guide without confrontation
4. **Develops the mirroring skill** - Simple repetition that builds rapport
5. **Explains the accusation audit** - Listing negatives first to defuse them
6. **Masters the "No" technique** - Making "no" work for you

## How to Use

### Prepare for a Negotiation
```
I have a negotiation coming up:
[Describe the situation, counterpart, and what you want]
Help me prepare using Never Split the Difference techniques.
```

### Handle a Difficult Objection
```
I'm facing this objection: [objection]
Apply Chris Voss techniques to help me respond effectively.
```

### Build Rapport Quickly
```
I need to establish trust quickly with [type of person/situation].
What FBI techniques can I use to build instant rapport?
```

## Instructions

### Step 1: Understand the Core Principles

```
## The Voss Framework

### Tactical Empathy
Understanding the feelings and mindset of another in the moment,
and also hearing what is behind those feelings.

"Empathy is not about agreeing. It's about understanding."

### The Late-Night FM DJ Voice
Calm, slow, and reassuring. This voice triggers a neurological
response that calms people down and makes them more open.

When to use: Tension, conflict, price discussions
How: Lower your voice, slow down, inflect downward

### Black Swans
Hidden pieces of information that, if uncovered, would change
everything. Every negotiation has 3-5 black swans.

Your job: Find them through curiosity, not assumptions.
```

---

### Step 2: Master the Core Techniques

```
## The 9 FBI Techniques

### 1. Mirroring
Repeat the last 1-3 words (or critical words) the other person said.

**How it works:**
- Creates rapport unconsciously
- Buys you time to think
- Encourages them to elaborate

**Example:**
Counterpart: "We just can't afford that price right now."
You: "Can't afford it right now?"
Counterpart: "Well, our Q3 budget is already allocated, but Q4..."

### 2. Labeling
Identify and verbalize the other person's emotions.

**Format:** "It seems like..." / "It sounds like..." / "It looks like..."

**Why:** Names the emotion, which diffuses its power.

**Example:**
"It seems like you're frustrated with the timeline."
"It sounds like there's some concern about implementation."
"It looks like you've had bad experiences before."

### 3. The Accusation Audit
List every negative thing the counterpart might say about you FIRST.

**Purpose:** Takes the sting out before they can use it.

**Format:**
"You're probably thinking [negative]..."
"It might seem like [negative]..."
"You might be wondering if [negative]..."

**Example:**
"You probably think we're too expensive. You might be wondering
if we'll deliver on time given we're a smaller firm. You could
be concerned we'll disappear after the sale..."

Then pause. Let them respond. Usually: "No, it's not that bad..."

### 4. Calibrated Questions
Open-ended questions starting with "How" or "What" that guide
without commanding.

**Never use:** "Why" (feels accusatory) or closed questions

**Power questions:**
- "How am I supposed to do that?"
- "What's going to happen if we don't solve this?"
- "How does this affect the rest of your team?"
- "What's the biggest challenge you're facing?"
- "How can we make this work for both of us?"

**"How am I supposed to do that?"**
The magic question for price objections. Makes them solve YOUR problem.

### 5. The "No" Technique
"No" gives people a sense of safety and control. Let them say it.

**How to use:**
- Ask questions designed to get "no"
- "Would it be ridiculous to...?"
- "Have you given up on this project?"
- "Is it a bad idea to...?"

**Why:** "No" is a starting point, not an ending.
After "no", people relax and become more receptive.

### 6. "That's Right"
The two most powerful words in negotiation.

**How to get there:**
1. Use labels and mirrors until they feel truly understood
2. Summarize their position better than they could
3. Wait for "that's right"

**Not the same as:** "You're right" (dismissive) or "Yes" (often fake)

**"That's right" = Breakthrough**

### 7. Bending Reality
Use anchoring and loss aversion to frame the negotiation.

**Techniques:**
- Anchor extreme: Start higher/lower than your target
- Use ranges: "$80K-$100K" anchors to $100K
- Use odd numbers: "$87,623" seems calculated, not arbitrary
- Emphasize losses: "Without this, you'll lose [X]"

### 8. The Ackerman Model
A systematic approach to price negotiation.

**Steps:**
1. Set your target price (what you actually want)
2. Set your first offer at 65% of target
3. Calculate three raises: 85%, 95%, 100%
4. Use lots of empathy before each raise
5. On final offer, use odd number and include non-monetary item

**Example (target: $100K):**
- First offer: $65K
- If pushed: $85K ("I really want to work together...")
- If pushed: $95K (with pain, empathy, labels)
- Final: $97,327 + free implementation support

### 9. Finding Black Swans
The hidden information that changes everything.

**How to find them:**
- Listen for what doesn't make sense
- Ask "What's making this hard?"
- Explore their constraints
- Watch for religion (deeply held beliefs)
- Notice what they're NOT saying

**Common Black Swans:**
- Budget constraints you didn't know
- Internal politics
- Hidden timelines
- Personal stakes
- Past bad experiences
```

---

### Step 3: Apply to Common Situations

```
## Negotiation Playbooks

### Price Objection
"Your price is too high."

**Response sequence:**
1. Mirror: "Too high?"
2. Label: "It sounds like budget is a real concern."
3. Calibrated: "How am I supposed to do that?" (let them solve it)
4. Accusation audit: "You probably think I'm just trying to squeeze more..."
5. Value reframe: Focus on what they LOSE without you

### The "I Need to Think About It" Stall

**Response:**
1. Label: "It seems like something's holding you back."
2. Pause and wait.
3. "What's the biggest concern you have right now?"
4. Address the real objection that emerges.

### The Competitor Threat
"Your competitor offered us X."

**Response:**
1. Label: "It sounds like you're weighing your options carefully."
2. Don't attack competitor.
3. Ask: "What would you be giving up by going with them?"
4. Focus on their losses, not your features.

### The Authority Dodge
"I need to run this by my boss."

**Response:**
1. Before negotiating: "Who else needs to be involved?"
2. During: "What's the biggest objection they might have?"
3. Equip them: "How can I help you present this internally?"
4. Get commitment: "If they say yes, are you ready to move forward?"

### The Ultimatum
"Take it or leave it."

**Response:**
1. Label: "It seems like you've reached your limit."
2. Pause. Let silence work.
3. "I understand. Before we end, can I ask what would need to change for this to work?"
4. Look for the Black Swan in their response.
```

### Step 4: Build Your Negotiation Prep

```
## Pre-Negotiation Worksheet

### 1. Know Your Goals
- **Target:** What's your ideal outcome?
- **Walk-away:** What's your minimum acceptable?
- **BATNA:** What happens if this fails?

### 2. Know Their World
- **What do they want?** (surface level)
- **What do they NEED?** (deeper)
- **What are their constraints?**
- **Who else is involved?**

### 3. Prepare Your Accusation Audit
List 5 negatives they might be thinking:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

### 4. Prepare Your Labels
Based on likely emotions:
- "It seems like..."
- "It sounds like..."
- "It looks like..."

### 5. Prepare Calibrated Questions
- "How can we..."
- "What would it take to..."
- "How does this affect..."

### 6. Identify Potential Black Swans
What don't I know that would change everything?
- About their situation?
- About their constraints?
- About their history?

### 7. Plan Your Ackerman (if price-based)
- Target:
- First offer (65%):
- Second (85%):
- Third (95%):
- Final (100% + non-monetary):
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Enterprise Software Negotiation

**Input:**
> "I'm negotiating a $200K software deal. The buyer says our price is too high and they have a competitor quote for $150K. How do I handle this?"

**Output:**

## Enterprise Deal Negotiation Strategy

### The Situation
- Your price: $200K
- Competitor quote: $150K (claimed)
- Gap: $50K (25%)

### What's Really Happening

The competitor card is the most common negotiation tactic. Don't panic.

**Black Swan possibilities:**
- The competitor quote may not be apples-to-apples
- They may actually prefer you but need justification
- There may be internal pressure to show "due diligence"
- The competitor may lack something critical you have

### Recommended Approach

**Step 1: Label and Mirror**
"It sounds like you're in a tough spot—you want to work with us, but the budget gap is significant."

*Wait for response*

**Step 2: Explore with Calibrated Questions**
- "What's included in that competitor quote?"
- "How does their implementation timeline compare?"
- "What would you be giving up if you went with them?"

*Listen for what's missing in the competitor offer*

**Step 3: Accusation Audit**
"You probably think we're overpriced. You might be wondering if we're just going to come down anyway. It probably seems like I'm going to give you the runaround on pricing..."

*Pause and let them respond*

**Step 4: "How Am I Supposed to Do That?"**
When they push on price:
"Help me understand—how am I supposed to bridge a $50K gap while still delivering the support and features you need?"

*This makes the problem theirs to solve*

**Step 5: Find the Black Swan**
Ask: "What's the biggest concern your team has about making this decision?"

Listen for the real issue—it's often not just price.

**Step 6: Reframe Around Loss**
"Let me make sure I understand what's at stake. If you go with the lower-cost option and [implementation fails / support isn't there / features are missing], what happens to your project?"

### If You Must Negotiate Price

Use Ackerman (target: $185K):
- Hold at $200K as long as possible
- First concession: $190K ("I talked to my team...")
- Second: $187K (with pain and empathy)
- Final: $184,750 + 30 days free support

**Never drop to $150K**—that validates their anchor.

---

### Example 2: Salary Negotiation

**Input:**
> "I received a job offer for $120K but I was hoping for $140K. The recruiter says that's their max budget. How do I negotiate?"

**Output:**

## Salary Negotiation Strategy

### Reframe the Situation

"Max budget" is rarely the max. It's the first limit they're willing to share.

### The Approach

**Step 1: Express Enthusiasm First**
"I'm really excited about this opportunity. The role and team are exactly what I've been looking for."

*Establish that you want this to work*

**Step 2: Label Their Constraint**
"It sounds like there are real budget constraints you're working within."

*Acknowledge their reality*

**Step 3: Calibrated Question**
"I understand the budget. Help me understand—what flexibility exists outside of base salary?"

*Opens the door to:*
- Sign-on bonus
- Equity/options
- Performance bonus
- Review timeline
- Title upgrade

**Step 4: The Accusation Audit**
"You probably think I'm going to push back hard and make this difficult. You might be worried I'll walk away if I don't get exactly what I want..."

*Let them respond—usually softens their position*

**Step 5: Create Collaborative Problem-Solving**
"How can we structure this so it works for both of us?"

### If They Hold on Base Salary

**Frame around value:**
"I appreciate you being upfront about the constraint. Here's what I'm thinking—I'm confident I'll outperform expectations. Would you be open to a 6-month review with potential adjustment if I hit [specific targets]?"

**Frame around loss:**
"I want to make this work. If I accept at $120K and find out I'm below market in six months, that's going to affect my engagement. How can we prevent that?"

### The Ackerman (if negotiating base)

Target: $135K
- First ask: $145K
- Second: $138K
- Third: $136K
- Final: $134,500 + sign-on bonus

**Key principle:** Never negotiate against yourself. Make them respond to each number.

### Example 3: Vendor Contract Renewal

**Input:**
> "Our vendor wants to raise prices 15% on renewal. We depend on them but feel like we're getting squeezed. How do I push back?"

**Output:**

## Vendor Renewal Negotiation

### The Challenge

You have leverage (existing relationship) but also dependency.
They have pricing power but also churn risk.

### Preparation

**Find Your Black Swans:**
- What's their churn rate? (high = you have leverage)
- Are they trying to hit quota? (timing = leverage)
- What's their cost to replace you? (acquisition costs)

**Your BATNA:**
- Can you switch vendors?
- What's the switching cost?
- Is there a credible alternative?

### The Negotiation

**Step 1: Start with the Relationship**
"We've been partners for [X years] and the relationship has been valuable to us."

*Anchor to the positive history*

**Step 2: Label Their Position**
"It sounds like your costs have increased and you need to adjust pricing across the board."

*Show you understand their side*

**Step 3: Accusation Audit**
"You're probably thinking we'll just accept it because switching is painful. You might assume we don't have alternatives. It might seem like we're locked in..."

*Watch their reaction*

**Step 4: Calibrated Questions**
- "How did you arrive at 15%?"
- "What's changed in the value we're receiving?"
- "How does this compare to what new customers pay?"

*Gather information*

**Step 5: The Key Question**
"15% is significant for us. How am I supposed to justify that internally when our budget is flat?"

*Make your problem their problem*

**Step 6: Offer Alternatives**
"I want to find a way forward. What if we:
- Commit to a longer term for better pricing?
- Remove features we're not fully using?
- Phase the increase over two years?

What would work for you?"

### If They Won't Budge

**Loss framing:**
"I need to be honest—at 15%, I'm going to have to present alternatives to my leadership. I'd rather not do that. What can we do together to avoid that?"

**Silence is power:**
After stating your position, stop talking. Let them fill the silence.

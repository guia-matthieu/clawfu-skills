# Design Trends 2026

> Apply the 10 dominant graphic design aesthetics of 2026 to any creative project — based on Kittl × Savee's trend report, backed by Adobe, Figma, and Pinterest platform data.

## When to Use This Skill

- **Briefing a designer or AI image generator** — translate vague "make it modern" into precise style vocabulary
- **Creating brand identity or visual refresh** — pick aesthetics that match your audience and positioning
- **Building mood boards** — combine trends with intent, not just screenshots
- **Designing social/marketing assets** — use visual languages trending on platforms right now
- **Pitching creative direction** — back your choices with data signals, not just taste

## Methodology Foundation

**Source**: Kittl × Savee — "2026 Design Trends Report" (January 2026)

**Core Principle**: 2026 design sits at the crossroads of two forces: human-made visuals are returning (Adobe reports +30% searches for hand-drawn elements), while AI accelerates exploration (60% of designers use AI for early concepts per Figma 2024). The best work in 2026 lives in between — messy meets precise, nostalgic meets futuristic, chaotic meets intentional.

**Why This Matters**: Trends aren't decoration — they're cultural signals. Choosing the right visual language connects you to what your audience already feels. Choosing the wrong one makes you invisible or dated. This skill gives you the vocabulary, the data, and the decision framework to pick deliberately.

## What Claude Does vs What You Decide

> "Claude maps the territory. You pick the direction."

| Claude handles | You provide |
|---------------|-------------|
| Identifying which trend(s) fit your brief | Your brand personality and audience |
| Generating precise AI image prompts per trend | Final aesthetic judgment and taste |
| Combining multiple trends into coherent direction | Business context (premium vs accessible, etc.) |
| Explaining the cultural signal behind each trend | Whether a trend aligns with your positioning |
| Creating mood board descriptions and style guides | Validation with real audience feedback |

**Remember**: Trends are tools, not rules. The skill helps you use them with intent.

## What This Skill Does

1. **Trend Identification** — Match a creative brief to the 1-3 most relevant 2026 trends
2. **Style Direction** — Provide precise visual vocabulary (colors, textures, typography, composition)
3. **AI Prompt Generation** — Create targeted prompts for Midjourney, DALL-E, Flux, Ideogram
4. **Trend Combination** — Layer multiple trends into original hybrid aesthetics
5. **Audience Mapping** — Connect visual choices to target demographics and platforms

## How to Use

### Match a trend to a brief
```
I'm designing a brand identity for [product/service] targeting [audience].
Use the design-trends-2026 skill to recommend the 2-3 best trends and explain why.
```

### Generate AI image prompts in a specific trend
```
Create 5 Midjourney prompts in the [trend name] style for [my project].
Use the design-trends-2026 skill for precise style vocabulary.
```

### Build a mood board rationale
```
I want to combine [trend A] and [trend B] for my brand.
Use design-trends-2026 to explain if this combination works and how to execute it.
```

## Instructions

When helping with visual direction using 2026 trends, follow this process:

### Step 1: Understand the Brief

Before recommending any trend, clarify:

```
## Brief Analysis

**Project type**: [brand identity / social campaign / packaging / web design / editorial]
**Target audience**: [demographics, psychographics, cultural affinities]
**Brand personality**: [playful / serious / rebellious / premium / accessible / technical]
**Platform**: [Instagram / print / web / packaging / multi-channel]
**Current visual identity**: [describe or "starting from scratch"]
**What they want to feel**: [specific emotion or reaction]
```

## The 10 Trends of 2026

### #1 — Naive Design
**Tagline**: "When messy beats perfect"

**Visual DNA**: Wobbly lines, uneven fills, scratchy linework, childlike illustrations, hand-drawn warmth, smiley shapes, shaky intentional strokes.

**Color palette**: Bright primaries, crayon-like tones, off-white or recycled paper backgrounds.

**Typography**: Hand-lettered, uneven baselines, marker or crayon textures.

**Cultural signal**: After years of AI-smooth perfection, people crave proof that a human made this. Naive design isn't unskilled — it's knowing the rules and bending them with confidence.

**Best for**:
| Audience | Why it works |
|----------|-------------|
| Children's products | Playful, trustworthy, engaging |
| Food & beverage / Craft brands | Approachable, honest, artisanal |
| Fashion & streetwear | Expressive, trend-forward |
| Creative agencies / Startups | Personality-driven, anti-corporate |
| Health & wellness | Warm, de-stresses clinical feel |

**AI prompt keywords**: `naive illustration, childlike drawing, wobbly linework, hand-drawn imperfect, crayon texture, uneven fills, sketchy warmth, doodle art`

**Combine well with**: Kid Core (amplify playfulness), Type Collage (add energy)

**Avoid combining with**: Surveillance Design, Blueprint Design (contradicts rawness)

**Reference image**: `docs/kittl-2026-trends/01-naive-design.png`

---

### #2 — Type Collage
**Tagline**: "High-impact typography as composition"

**Visual DNA**: Multiple fonts, sizes, and styles mixed in one layout. Overlapping text, rotated blocks, cut-paper aesthetic. Visual maximalism through typography alone.

**Color palette**: High contrast — black/white base with 1-2 bold accent colors. Or full neon spectrum.

**Typography**: 3+ typefaces per composition. Serif + sans-serif + display. Variable weights. Text IS the visual.

**Cultural signal**: Platform-native creativity meets DIY zine nostalgia. Gen Z finds this fresh and authentic. Bold, eclectic, breaks rules intentionally.

**Best for**:
| Audience | Why it works |
|----------|-------------|
| Music / Events / Festivals | Creates instant energy and mood |
| Fashion brands | Trend-forward, editorial feel |
| Social media content | Scroll-stopping, platform-native |
| Magazines / Editorial | Bold layout experimentation |
| Youth-oriented brands | Culturally fluent, maximalist |

**AI prompt keywords**: `type collage, mixed typography, overlapping text, typographic composition, zine layout, cut-paper lettering, bold type mix, maximalist typography`

**Combine well with**: Punk Grunge (add rebellion), Naive Design (add warmth)

**Avoid combining with**: Grainy Blur (legibility conflict)

**Reference image**: `docs/kittl-2026-trends/02-type-collage.png`

---

### #3 — Blueprint Design
**Tagline**: "Over-explaining as aesthetic"

**Visual DNA**: Technical drawing language — arrows, measurements, exploded views, labeled parts, grid backgrounds, schematic lines, annotation callouts. A sneaker deconstructed into 47 parts. Ramen mapped like a machine.

**Color palette**: Classic blueprint (white lines on blue), or inverted (dark lines on cream/white). Monochromatic with one accent color.

**Typography**: Monospaced, technical, small caps, DIN-like typefaces. Labels and annotations as design elements.

**Cultural signal**: Makes ordinary products feel engineered and considered. Obsessive detail is the flex. Witty over-explanation as visual humor.

**Best for**:
| Audience | Why it works |
|----------|-------------|
| Tech / SaaS products | Signals precision and craft |
| Sneaker / Streetwear culture | Detail-obsessed audience loves this |
| Food & beverage (craft) | "Ingredients deconstructed" |
| Product launches | Makes anything feel considered |
| Design-savvy consumers | Clever, detail-rich, rewarding to study |

**AI prompt keywords**: `blueprint design, technical drawing, exploded view diagram, schematic illustration, annotated product, engineering diagram style, labeled parts, grid background, measurement lines`

**Combine well with**: Surveillance Design (shared precision), Signal Graphics (add energy)

**Avoid combining with**: Naive Design (opposite precision), Grainy Blur (contradicts clarity)

**Reference image**: `docs/kittl-2026-trends/03-blueprint-design.png`

---

### #4 — Trinket Design
**Tagline**: "Objects as identity"

**Visual DNA**: Everyday objects (shells, buttons, coins, fruit, crystals) arranged in neat grids or museum-style flat lays. Part still life, part scrapbook. Overhead photography, soft shadows, neutral backgrounds.

**Color palette**: Muted naturals — cream, stone, blush, sage. Objects bring the color. Warm, tactile.

**Typography**: Minimal, elegant serif or thin sans-serif. Secondary to the objects.

**Cultural signal**: Our cultural obsession with curation — Pinterest boards, "what's in my bag" posts, shelf styling. Identity expressed through what you collect.

**Best for**:
| Audience | Why it works |
|----------|-------------|
| Lifestyle brands | Personal yet aspirational |
| Fashion & accessories | Product curation narrative |
| Wellness & beauty | Tactile, ingredient storytelling |
| Editorial / Magazines | Elevated flat lay aesthetic |
| E-commerce | Product-in-context styling |

**AI prompt keywords**: `trinket design, curated flat lay, museum display arrangement, object collection grid, still life curation, knolling photography, tactile objects, overhead arrangement`

**Combine well with**: Grainy Blur (add dreaminess), Naive Design (add warmth)

**Avoid combining with**: Punk Grunge (contradicts tidiness), Signal Graphics (too chaotic)

**Reference image**: `docs/kittl-2026-trends/04-trinket-design.png`

---

### #5 — Punk Grunge
**Tagline**: "Rebellious voice through art"

**Visual DNA**: Torn paper textures, xerox noise, aggressive typography, spray paint marks, stickers, tape, ripped edges. Raw, loud, intentionally messy. Anti-polish as statement.

**Color palette**: High contrast — black and white base, neon accents (hot pink, electric yellow, red). Dirty textures over everything.

**Typography**: Distressed, stamped, stenciled, cut-out ransom-note style. Typewriter. Handwritten with anger.

**Cultural signal**: Direct backlash to AI-smooth perfection. Designers inject soul into the algorithm. Not rage against machines — a course correction toward grit, surprise, and human fingerprints.

**Best for**:
| Audience | Why it works |
|----------|-------------|
| Music / Underground culture | Authentic rebel aesthetic |
| Streetwear / Skate brands | Counter-culture credibility |
| Indie / Alternative brands | Anti-corporate positioning |
| Youth activism / Zines | DIY ethos, accessible production |
| Craft beer / Tattoo studios | Raw, unapologetic personality |

**AI prompt keywords**: `punk grunge design, torn paper collage, xerox texture, distressed typography, spray paint marks, sticker bomb, ripped edges, raw gritty aesthetic, anti-design`

**Combine well with**: Type Collage (amplify energy), Naive Design (softer rebellion)

**Avoid combining with**: Frutiger Aero (opposite polarity), Trinket Design (contradicts chaos)

**Reference image**: `docs/kittl-2026-trends/05-punk-grunge.webp`

---

### #6 — Future Medieval
**Tagline**: "Design like it's 1426 — and 2026"

**Visual DNA**: Gothic arches, ornate borders, illuminated manuscript details, heraldic symbols — combined with digital glitches, neon accents, futuristic overlays. Baroque maximalism meets cyberpunk.

**Color palette**: Deep jewel tones (burgundy, royal blue, gold) with electric neon highlights (cyan, magenta). Dark backgrounds.

**Typography**: Blackletter / Gothic as primary. Paired with thin sans-serif or monospace for contrast. Decorative initials.

**Cultural signal**: Breaking out of minimalism to tell richer stories. Pinterest and Adobe confirm a surge in medieval font searches. Familiar history plus new digital twists = psychological appeal.

**Best for**:
| Audience | Why it works |
|----------|-------------|
| Gaming / Fantasy brands | Natural aesthetic fit |
| Premium / Luxury brands | Ornate = high perceived value |
| Music (metal, dark electronic) | Genre-native visual language |
| Fashion (dark, avant-garde) | Editorial drama |
| Craft / Artisanal spirits | Heritage + modernity |

**AI prompt keywords**: `future medieval, gothic digital art, illuminated manuscript modern, blackletter neon, heraldic cyberpunk, ornate border glitch, dark baroque futuristic, medieval meets digital`

**Combine well with**: Distorted Portrait (add drama), Surveillance Design (dark tech layer)

**Avoid combining with**: Kid Core (tonal mismatch), Naive Design (too light)

**Reference image**: `docs/kittl-2026-trends/06-future-medieval.png`

---

### #7 — Distorted Portrait
**Tagline**: "Express your boldest state of mind"

**Visual DNA**: Faces stretched, glitched, liquified, fragmented, or layered. Warped features, double exposures, scan-line effects, pixel displacement. Human but uncanny.

**Color palette**: Anything — moody monochrome, saturated neon, or natural tones with glitch accents. The distortion IS the color story.

**Typography**: Distorted to match — warped baselines, glitched letterforms, stretched type.

**Cultural signal**: Escape from "polished but predictable." Expressive, human, and subversive in an age of AI-made stock faces. With AR filters and VR avatars growing, distortion bridges static art and immersive spaces.

**Best for**:
| Audience | Why it works |
|----------|-------------|
| Music / Album art | Emotional, expressive storytelling |
| Fashion / Beauty brands | Subversive, avant-garde edge |
| Mental health / Wellbeing | Visualizing internal states |
| Art / Gallery / Cultural | Conceptual depth |
| Tech / AI brands | Human-meets-digital metaphor |

**AI prompt keywords**: `distorted portrait, glitch face, liquified features, double exposure portrait, fragmented face, pixel displacement, warped portrait photography, scan line distortion`

**Combine well with**: Punk Grunge (amplify rawness), Grainy Blur (add dream quality)

**Avoid combining with**: Blueprint Design (opposite mood), Trinket Design (conflicting subjects)

**Reference image**: `docs/kittl-2026-trends/07-distorted-portrait.png`

---

### #8 — Surveillance Design
**Tagline**: "When precision footage speaks"

**Visual DNA**: CCTV feeds, biometric HUDs, recognition boxes, crosshairs, system logs, monochrome overlays, timestamp structures. UI elements extracted from security systems. Strict grids, utilitarian typography.

**Color palette**: High contrast minimal — black, white, green (night vision), red (alerts). Monochrome with data overlay accents.

**Typography**: Monospaced (Courier, JetBrains Mono), all-caps system text, timestamps, coordinates, status labels.

**Cultural signal**: Controlled dystopian aesthetic that communicates observation, precision, and data flow. Merges conceptual sharpness with cultural relevance around identity, visibility, and control.

**Best for**:
| Audience | Why it works |
|----------|-------------|
| Tech / Cybersecurity brands | Native visual language |
| Music (electronic, industrial) | Dark, atmospheric |
| Fashion (techwear, utility) | Functional aesthetic |
| Data / Analytics products | Precision signaling |
| Film / Media (thriller, sci-fi) | Atmospheric mood setting |

**AI prompt keywords**: `surveillance design, CCTV aesthetic, biometric HUD overlay, security camera feed, system log typography, crosshair targeting, night vision green, dystopian data interface`

**Combine well with**: Blueprint Design (shared precision), Future Medieval (dark layering)

**Avoid combining with**: Naive Design (opposite mood), Kid Core (tonal clash)

**Reference image**: `docs/kittl-2026-trends/08-surveillance-design.webp`

---

### #9 — Grainy Blur
**Tagline**: "Creating dreamy, emotional graphics"

**Visual DNA**: Soft-focus effects with grainy/noise overlays. Out-of-focus photography or gradients. Film grain texture. Muted or pastel tones bleeding into each other. Cinematic, analog warmth.

**Color palette**: Desaturated pastels, muted earth tones, or moody darks — all with visible grain/noise. Warm analog film colors.

**Typography**: Soft, elegant, often slightly transparent or blended into the blur. Serif or thin sans-serif.

**Cultural signal**: Audiences are tired of ultra-sharp "perfect" images. Embracing imperfection adds warmth, depth, and authenticity. Feels cinematic, dreamy, and emotionally charged.

**Best for**:
| Audience | Why it works |
|----------|-------------|
| Music / Album covers | Mood-driven, emotional |
| Beauty / Skincare brands | Soft, aspirational, tactile |
| Wellness / Meditation | Calm, atmospheric |
| Fashion (editorial) | Dreamy, cinematic feel |
| Hospitality / Travel | Romantic, aspirational |

**AI prompt keywords**: `grainy blur design, soft focus noise texture, film grain overlay, dreamy blurred gradient, analog photography aesthetic, cinematic grain, muted pastel blur, out-of-focus noise`

**Combine well with**: Trinket Design (add texture), Distorted Portrait (add emotion)

**Avoid combining with**: Blueprint Design (contradicts precision), Surveillance Design (opposite warmth)

**Reference images**: `docs/kittl-2026-trends/09-grainy-blur-main.webp`, `09-grainy-blur-noise.webp`, `09-grainy-blur-floral.webp`

---

### #10 — Signal Graphics
**Tagline**: "Kinetic visuals from 90s TV and Y2K"

**Visual DNA**: Animated shapes, colliding/mutating objects, explosive color. 3D and flat graphics mixed. Hyper-saturated, cartoonish, loud. Early CGI energy, exploding shapes, screen idents, color overload.

**Color palette**: Maximum saturation — neon green, electric blue, hot pink, chrome silver. Gradients everywhere. Shiny, glossy surfaces.

**Typography**: Bold, 3D-extruded, chrome or gradient fills. Playful, oversized, impossible to ignore.

**Cultural signal**: 90s/Y2K nostalgia meets today's overstimulated social feeds. Designed to move, interrupt, and stand out in noisy environments. Entertainment over subtlety.

**Best for**:
| Audience | Why it works |
|----------|-------------|
| Music / Podcasts | Loud, attention-grabbing |
| Apparel / Merch | Bold graphic tees and prints |
| Gaming / Esports | Native energy level |
| Digital campaigns | Scroll-stopping social content |
| Gen Z / Youth brands | Nostalgic yet fresh |

**AI prompt keywords**: `signal graphics, Y2K design, 90s TV ident, exploding shapes, hyper-saturated 3D, chrome text, early CGI aesthetic, neon color overload, kinetic graphics`

**Combine well with**: Type Collage (maximalist pairing), Punk Grunge (rebellious energy)

**Avoid combining with**: Trinket Design (opposite energy), Grainy Blur (contradicts sharpness)

**Reference image**: `docs/kittl-2026-trends/10-signal-graphics.webp`

---

## Honorable Mentions

### Frutiger Aero
**Tagline**: "The glossy techno-utopia of early 2000s"

**Visual DNA**: Glossy aqua gradients, floating globes, lens flares, bubble-like shapes, glass morphism, XP-era wallpaper energy. Clean, optimistic, digital-first.

**Color palette**: Aqua, sky blue, white, silver, translucent glass. Bright, clean, airy.

**AI prompt keywords**: `frutiger aero, glossy aqua gradient, Windows XP aesthetic, techno utopian, glass morphism, lens flare, bubble interface, clean digital optimism, Y2K tech`

### Step 3: Map Trends to Audience Segments

Use this decision matrix to narrow down:

| If your audience is... | Primary trend | Supporting trend |
|------------------------|---------------|------------------|
| Gen Z, social-native | Type Collage | Signal Graphics or Punk Grunge |
| Premium/luxury consumers | Future Medieval | Trinket Design |
| Tech-savvy professionals | Blueprint Design | Surveillance Design |
| Wellness/lifestyle | Grainy Blur | Trinket Design or Naive Design |

| Rebels/counter-culture | Punk Grunge | Type Collage |
| Music/entertainment | Distorted Portrait | Signal Graphics |
| Food & beverage (craft) | Naive Design | Blueprint Design |
| Fashion (editorial) | Distorted Portrait | Grainy Blur |
| SaaS / Digital product | Frutiger Aero | Blueprint Design |

---

### Step 4: Generate Creative Assets

Once the trend(s) are selected, produce the deliverable:

**For AI image prompts**, structure as:
```
[Subject/scene description], [trend-specific style keywords from catalog above],
[color palette direction], [composition notes], [mood/atmosphere],
[technical: resolution, aspect ratio]
```

**For mood board descriptions**, include:
```
## Mood Board: [Project Name]

**Primary trend**: [Trend] — [Why this fits the brief]
**Supporting trend**: [Trend] — [What it adds]
**Color direction**: [Specific palette]
**Typography direction**: [Font families, treatment]
**Texture/treatment**: [Specific textures, effects]
**What to AVOID**: [Anti-references — trends that would send wrong signal]
```

**For style guide language**, provide:
```
## Visual Language Guide

**We are**: [2-3 adjectives from trend DNA]
**We are NOT**: [2-3 adjectives from opposite trends]
**Our visual references**: [Trend names + specific elements to use]
**Our visual anti-references**: [Trend names + specific elements to avoid]
```

---

## Examples

### Example 1: Craft Coffee Brand Identity

**Context**: New specialty coffee roaster targeting urban 25-35 year-olds who value authenticity.

**Input**:
> I'm launching a craft coffee brand called "Grounds." Our audience is urban millennials who care about origin and process. We want to feel artisanal but not precious. What 2026 trends fit?

**Output**:

**Primary: Blueprint Design (#3)**
Your audience loves process and origin stories. Blueprint Design lets you deconstruct the coffee journey — bean anatomy, roasting temperature curves, brewing ratios — as visual identity. It signals "we're obsessed with craft" without being pretentious.

**Supporting: Naive Design (#1)**
Balance the technical precision with hand-drawn warmth. Wobbly illustrations of coffee plants, hand-lettered origin names. This combination says "deeply knowledgeable but approachable."

**Avoid**: Punk Grunge (too aggressive for a morning ritual), Future Medieval (wrong emotional register), Signal Graphics (too loud for a meditative product).

**AI prompt for packaging**:
```
Specialty coffee bag design, blueprint technical drawing of coffee bean cross-section
with labeled parts and measurement annotations on cream background, hand-drawn naive
illustration of coffee plant in corner, monospaced typography for origin details,
warm artisanal feel with engineering precision, product packaging mockup
```

**Mood board direction**:
- Color: Cream base + deep brown + one accent (terracotta or sage)
- Type: DIN or Space Mono for technical labels + hand-lettered brand name
- Texture: Light grid paper background, subtle pencil marks
- Composition: Annotated product diagrams as hero graphics

**Why this works**: Blueprint + Naive is a trend combination that doesn't exist in the source report — it's a synthesis that creates something original while staying on-trend.

---

### Example 2: Electronic Music Festival Social Campaign

**Context**: Summer electronic music festival wants social content that stands out in crowded music feeds.

**Input**:
> Design direction for "SIGNAL" festival social campaign. Electronic music, 18-30 audience, need to dominate Instagram and TikTok.

**Output**:

**Primary: Signal Graphics (#10)** — The name practically writes the brief. Y2K energy, hyper-saturated 3D shapes, exploding colors. Your audience grew up on this. It's nostalgic AND future-facing.

**Supporting: Distorted Portrait (#7)** — Artist announcements as distorted portraits create instant intrigue. Glitch the lineup photos. Make people stop scrolling to figure out who it is.

**Third layer: Surveillance Design (#8)** — Festival countdown content as system logs and CCTV-style feeds. "SIGNAL DETECTED" as recurring copy framework.

**AI prompts for social posts**:

Artist announcement:
```
Electronic music DJ portrait with pixel displacement and scan-line distortion,
neon magenta and electric cyan color scheme, fragmented face with glitch effects,
dark background with surveillance grid overlay, hyper-saturated Y2K aesthetic,
square format for Instagram
```

Event countdown:
```
Surveillance camera interface design showing countdown timer, green night vision
aesthetic with CCTV timestamp, "SIGNAL DETECTED" text in monospaced font,
crosshair overlay, dark dystopian data interface, Instagram story format 9:16
```

General campaign asset:
```
Exploding 3D chrome shapes on black background, hyper-saturated neon colors,
90s TV ident energy, signal graphics style, kinetic explosive composition,
bold 3D extruded text, Y2K nostalgia meets futuristic, widescreen 16:9
```

**Why this works**: Three trends that share energy levels (high) and audience alignment (young, digital-native). The combination creates a distinct festival identity that other events can't replicate by copying just one trend.

---

### Example 3: Wellness App Brand Refresh

**Context**: Meditation/wellness app needs a visual refresh to stand out from the "generic calm" aesthetic.

**Input**:
> Every wellness app looks the same — soft gradients, thin fonts, too much white space. How do we differentiate while still feeling calm?

**Output**:

**Primary: Grainy Blur (#9)** — Still calm, but with analog warmth instead of digital sterility. Film grain adds texture and humanity. Soft focus creates atmosphere without the "stock photo meditation" look.

**Supporting: Trinket Design (#4)** — Instead of generic nature photos, curate meaningful objects: a smooth stone, a tea cup, a candle, a journal. Flat-lay curation feels personal and aspirational.

**Avoid**: Naive Design (too playful for the category), Punk Grunge (wrong energy entirely), Signal Graphics (sensory overload contradicts purpose).

**What makes this different from competitors**:
Most wellness apps use sharp, clean gradients (Headspace/Calm aesthetic circa 2020). Grainy Blur introduces tactile warmth — it feels like looking through a slightly fogged window. Trinket Design adds personality through objects instead of generic illustrations.

**Style guide language**:
```
We are: Warm, textured, intentionally imperfect
We are NOT: Clinical, sharp, digitally sterile
Our references: Grainy Blur (atmosphere) + Trinket Design (curation)
Our anti-references: Frutiger Aero (too tech), Blueprint (too analytical)
```

## Skill Boundaries (Frontier Recognition)

### This skill excels for:
- Selecting and combining visual aesthetics for specific audiences
- Generating precise AI prompts in trending styles
- Building mood boards and style guides with cultural rationale
- Differentiating from competitors by choosing less obvious trend combinations

### This skill is NOT ideal for:
- **Predicting which trends will last** → Trends are signals, not guarantees. Validate with your audience.
- **Replacing a trained graphic designer** → The skill provides direction, not production files.
- **Non-visual branding decisions** → Use `brand-strategy` or `positioning` skills for messaging/positioning.
- **Hyper-local or niche subcultures** → These 10 trends are mainstream signals. Subcultures move faster and differently.

### Quality Checkpoints

Before accepting the output, verify:
- [ ] Recommended trend genuinely matches the target audience (not just "looks cool")
- [ ] Cultural signal explanation makes sense for the brand's positioning
- [ ] AI prompts are specific enough to produce consistent results
- [ ] Combination doesn't create tonal contradictions (check "avoid combining" guidance)
- [ ] The direction differentiates from competitors (not just following the same trend they use)

---

## Iteration Guide

> "First pass picks the trend. Second pass makes it yours."

### Recommended Iteration Pattern

| Pass | Focus | Questions to Ask |
|------|-------|------------------|
| **1st** | Trend selection | "Does this trend match what my audience already responds to?" |
| **2nd** | Combination | "Does the primary + supporting trend create something original?" |
| **3rd** | Specificity | "Are the AI prompts / mood board descriptions precise enough to brief someone?" |
| **4th** | Differentiation | "Would a competitor arrive at this same combination? If yes, push further." |

### Useful Follow-up Prompts

- "This feels too generic. Push toward a less obvious trend combination for [audience]."
- "My competitor already uses [trend]. What's adjacent but different?"
- "Show me how this trend would apply to [specific deliverable: packaging / social / web header]."
- "Create 3 variations — one safe, one bold, one experimental."
- "What would [specific designer or brand you admire] do with this trend?"

---

## Learning Curve

| Usage | What You'll Experience |
|-------|----------------------|
| **1st use** | You discover the 10 trends and get initial direction |
| **3rd use** | You start requesting specific combinations and challenging generic matches |
| **10th use** | The trend vocabulary becomes second nature; you brief designers and AI tools with precision |

**Pro tip**: The "avoid combining" guidance is as valuable as the "combine well with" guidance. Knowing what NOT to do prevents tonal accidents.

- [ ] Trend matches your personal taste but not your audience's expectations
- [ ] AI prompts are too generic (no specific textures, colors, or composition notes)
- [ ] The direction would look identical to a competitor's
- [ ] Trend is already saturating in your category (late follower, not early adopter)

**Strategic Implication**: Don't optimize everything equally. Find your top performers and make them even better. Find your worst performers and eliminate them.

### Step 1: The Conversion-First Mindset

Before worrying about traffic, get conversion right.

> "Most people think traffic is 80% of the battle, but it's really 20%. CONVERSION is 80% of the battle."

**The Order of Operations:**

| Priority | Focus | Why |
|----------|-------|-----|
| 1 | Landing page conversion | Without this, all traffic is wasted |
| 2 | Offer/value proposition | Must be compelling enough to convert |
| 3 | Ad relevance to landing page | Quality Score and conversion both improve |
| 4 | Keyword selection | Target the right searchers |
| 5 | Traffic scaling | Only AFTER 1-4 are solid |

**Conversion Benchmarks:**
- If conversion rate is <1%, fix the landing page first
- If conversion rate is 2-5%, you can optimize ads
- If conversion rate is >5%, you can start scaling traffic

---

### Step 2: Campaign Structure for Quality Score

**Match Type Segmentation:**

Separate your keywords by match type into different ad groups or campaigns:

```
Campaign: [Product Name]
├── Ad Group: Exact Match Keywords
│   └── [keyword] → dedicated ads
├── Ad Group: Phrase Match Keywords
│   └── "keyword" → dedicated ads
├── Ad Group: Modified Broad Match
│   └── +keyword → dedicated ads
└── Ad Group: Broad Match (for discovery)
    └── keyword → catch-all ads
```

**Why This Works:**
- Exact match keywords get highest relevance scores
- You can bid aggressively on exact (known performers)
- Broad match becomes a "fishing expedition" for new terms
- Each match type gets appropriate bid strategy

**The Peel and Stick Technique:**

1. **Run broad match** to discover what people actually search
2. **Check Search Terms Report** for high-performers
3. **"Peel"** those terms out of broad match
4. **"Stick"** them into their own exact match ad groups
5. **Create dedicated ads** for each peeled term
6. **Add negative** of exact match to broad campaign

**Result**: Continuous refinement, higher Quality Scores, lower costs.

### Step 3: Rack the Shotgun (Qualify Before the Click)

> "The art of sorting out your customers, weeding out the qualified from the non-qualified, is one of the most important skills you can develop."

**80/20 Reality**: 80% of people who click will never buy. You're paying for all of them.

**Pre-Qualification Tactics:**

| Tactic | How It Works | Example |
|--------|--------------|---------|
| **Price in ad** | Scares away non-buyers | "$499/month starting price" |
| **Specificity** | Attracts only right audience | "Enterprise-only" or "For teams of 50+" |
| **Qualification language** | Self-selection | "If you're serious about..." |
| **Negative keywords** | Block bad searchers | -free, -cheap, -DIY, -jobs |
| **Callout extensions** | Set expectations | "Minimum $10K project" |

**Five Power Disqualifiers:**

Before someone becomes a lead, they should pass:

1. **Money** - Do they have budget for your solution?
2. **Authority** - Can they make the purchase decision?
3. **Need** - Do they have the problem you solve?
4. **Timing** - Are they ready to act now?
5. **Fit** - Are they the right customer for you?

**Landing Page Qualification:**
- Add a short quiz: "Is [Product] right for you?"
- Include pricing or "starting at" to filter budget
- Use specific case studies that speak to ideal customers
- Make non-buyers self-select out

---

### Step 4: The Optimization Onion

Peel back optimization layers in the right order:

```
                OPTIMIZATION PRIORITY
    ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
    │                                     │
    │  OUTER LAYER (Do First)             │
    │  ├── Match type segmentation        │
    │  ├── Ad extensions (all of them)    │
    │  └── Negative keywords              │
    │                                     │
    │  MIDDLE LAYER (Do Second)           │
    │  ├── Ad copy split testing          │
    │  ├── Landing page optimization      │
    │  └── Bid adjustments by device      │
    │                                     │
    │  INNER LAYER (Do Third)             │
    │  ├── Audience targeting             │
    │  ├── Day/time bidding              │
    │  └── Geographic bid adjustments     │
    │                                     │
    │  CORE (Only After Everything Else)  │
    │  └── Increase budget/bids           │
    │                                     │
    └─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Perry's Rule:**

> "Your first response should NOT be 'I'm going to spend more money.' Your first response should be 'Am I optimizing everything I can really optimize?'"

---

### Step 5: 80/20 Budget Allocation

**Where to Put Your Money:**

| Performance Level | Budget Allocation | Strategy |
|-------------------|-------------------|----------|
| **Top 20% of keywords** | 64% of budget | Scale aggressively |
| **Middle 60%** | 30% of budget | Test and optimize |
| **Bottom 20%** | 6% of budget | Cut or pause |

**Identifying Your 80/20:**

1. Export last 90 days of keyword data
2. Sort by conversions (not clicks!)
3. Calculate cumulative % of total conversions
4. Mark where you hit 80% of conversions
5. Count how many keywords got you there (usually ~20%)
6. These are your "vital few"

**The 80/20 of 80/20:**
- Within your top 20%, another 80/20 exists
- 4% of keywords often drive 50%+ of conversions
- These deserve individual campaigns, dedicated landing pages

---

### Step 6: Scaling Profitably

**When to Scale:**

Only after:
- [ ] Conversion tracking is accurate
- [ ] ROI is positive at current spend
- [ ] Quality Scores are 7+ on main keywords
- [ ] All optimization layers addressed
- [ ] You understand your customer acquisition economics

**How to Scale:**

| Method | When to Use | Risk Level |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| **Increase bids on winners** | Top 20% keywords | Low |
| **Add similar keywords** | Proven ad groups | Medium |
| **Expand match types** | Exact → Phrase | Medium |
| **New campaigns/audiences** | After core is solid | Higher |
| **Increase daily budget** | All above done | Low |

**Warning Signs to Stop Scaling:**
- CPA increases by >20%
- Conversion rate drops significantly
- Quality Score declining
- Impression share not improving with budget

---

### Step 7: Advanced 80/20 Strategies

**Tiered Offering Strategy:**

> "20% of people are willing to spend 4x the money for a better experience."

If your main offer is $100, consider:
- Standard: $100 (for 80%)
- Premium: $400 (for 16%)
- Elite: $1,600 (for 4%)

**Run separate campaigns for each tier** - the economics are different.

**Predictive Budgeting:**

Using 80/20 math to predict market size:
- If 1,000 people buy at $50
- ~200 will pay $200 (4x)
- ~40 will pay $800 (16x)
- ~8 will pay $3,200 (64x)

**Plan campaigns and landing pages for each segment.**

## Examples

### Example 1: E-commerce Store Optimization

**Situation**: Online store selling specialty kitchen equipment. Spending $5,000/month on Google Ads with 2.5% conversion rate. Wants to improve ROI.

**80/20 Analysis:**

Exported 90 days of data, found:
- 147 active keywords
- 23 keywords (16%) drove 81% of sales
- 6 keywords (4%) drove 52% of sales
- 87 keywords (59%) had zero conversions

**Action Plan:**

**1. Immediate (Outer Layer):**
- Pause 87 zero-conversion keywords → Save ~$800/month
- Add negative keywords from Search Terms Report
- Enable all ad extensions (was missing callouts, structured snippets)

**2. Structure (Match Types):**
- Create exact match campaign for top 23 keywords
- Create separate ad groups for top 6 keywords
- Move existing to phrase/broad for discovery

**3. Qualify Better:**
- Add price to ads: "From $89 - Premium Kitchen Tools"
- Landing page: Added "Who this is for" section
- Negative keywords: -cheap, -wholesale, -bulk, -used

**4. Scale Winners:**
- Top 6 keywords: Increased bids 30%
- Created dedicated landing pages for top 3 products
- Built remarketing lists from converters

**Results after 60 days:**
- Spend: $4,200/month (down 16%)
- Conversions: Up 34%
- ROAS: Improved from 3.2x to 5.1x

### Example 2: B2B SaaS Lead Generation

**Situation**: SaaS company generating leads via Google Ads. Getting lots of clicks but low quality leads. Sales team complaining about tire-kickers.

**Problem Diagnosis:**

Using 80/20 thinking:
- 80% of leads were unqualified (too small, no budget, wrong use case)
- 80% of wasted ad spend came from broad match fishing

**Rack the Shotgun Implementation:**

**1. Ad Copy Qualification:**
Before: "Project Management Software - Free Trial"
After: "Project Management for Teams 50+ | Starting $499/mo"

**2. Landing Page Qualification:**
Added "Is [Product] Right For You?" quiz:
- Team size?
- Current tools?
- Budget range?
- Timeline to implement?

Score < 60 = Blog content offer
Score 60-80 = Self-serve trial
Score > 80 = Sales call booking

**3. Campaign Structure:**
- Separate campaign for enterprise keywords
- Separate campaign for SMB keywords
- Different landing pages, different qualification levels

**4. Negative Keywords:**
Added: -free, -open source, -small business, -startup, -cheap, -alternative to [competitor targeting SMB]

**Results:**
- Clicks: Down 40%
- Cost: Down 35%
- Qualified leads: Up 60%
- Sales accepted leads: Up 180%
- Cost per qualified lead: Down 58%

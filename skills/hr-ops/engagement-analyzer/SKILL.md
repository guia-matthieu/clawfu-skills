## Pulse Survey Quick Analysis

### Summary

| Metric | Current | Change | Status |
|--------|---------|--------|--------|
| eNPS Indicator | 62% | ↓ 8% | WARNING |
| Enablement | 71% | ↑ 3% | GOOD |
| Recognition | 48% | ↓ 12% | CRITICAL |

### Key Finding

**Recognition is in crisis** - 12-point drop is a red flag.
This is likely driving the eNPS decline.

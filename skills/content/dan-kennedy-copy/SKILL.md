# Dan Kennedy Direct Response Copywriting

> Write copy that sells NOW using Dan Kennedy's "No B.S." direct response marketing principles

## When to Use This Skill

- **Writing sales copy** that must generate immediate, trackable response
- **Creating direct mail pieces**, sales letters, or landing pages for local businesses
- **Designing marketing funnels** with clear offers at every stage
- **Breaking free from "brand advertising"** that doesn't produce measurable ROI

## Methodology Foundation

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Source** | No B.S. Direct Marketing, Magnetic Marketing System |
| **Expert** | Dan Kennedy - Direct response legend, GKIC founder, consultant to hundreds of businesses |
| **Core Principle** | "Your agenda is simple: Sell something. Now." - Every piece of marketing must make an offer, track results, and be accountable |


## What Claude Does vs What You Decide

| Claude Does | You Decide |
|-------------|------------|
| Structures video workflow | Final creative vision |
| Suggests shot compositions | Equipment selection |
| Creates storyboard templates | Brand aesthetics |
| Generates script frameworks | Final approval |
| Identifies technical requirements | Budget allocation |

## What This Skill Does

This skill transforms your marketing from vague brand advertising into accountable direct response that sells. Dan Kennedy's approach is brutally simple: if you can't track the money coming back, stop doing it.

Instead of copying big brand advertisers (which will bankrupt small businesses), you'll:
1. Always include a specific offer
2. Create urgency to respond NOW
3. Give crystal-clear instructions
4. Track everything
5. Follow up relentlessly
6. Write copy that SELLS, not entertains

The result: marketing where every dollar is accountable and you know exactly what's working.

## How to Use

### Prompt Examples

```
Write a direct response sales letter for my [service] following Dan Kennedy's
10 rules. Include a strong offer, urgency element, and clear call-to-action.
```

```
Create a lead magnet offer (low threshold) and a purchase offer (high threshold)
for my [business type] using Kennedy's threshold resistance concept.
```

```
Design a 4-email follow-up sequence for leads who downloaded my free report
but haven't purchased. Use Kennedy's escalating urgency approach.
```

```
Audit this marketing piece against Kennedy's 10 rules and tell me what's
missing or weak.
```

```
Write a "reason to respond NOW" section for my [offer] using Kennedy's
urgency tactics without being sleazy.
```

## Instructions

### Step 1: Apply the 10 Rules Checklist

Before writing anything, ensure your marketing will include:

| Rule | Question to Ask | Fix If Missing |
|------|-----------------|----------------|
| 1. Offer | Does it ask for specific action? | Add purchase AND lead-gen offer |
| 2. Urgency | Is there a reason to respond NOW? | Add deadline, limit, or bonus |
| 3. Instructions | Are next steps crystal clear? | Spell out exactly what to do |
| 4. Tracking | Can you measure response? | Add unique codes/links |
| 5. No Brand Waste | Are you buying response, not awareness? | Cut anything without ROI |
| 6. Follow-Up | What happens after first contact? | Build sequence |
| 7. Strong Copy | Does it SELL, not just inform? | Rewrite emotionally |
| 8. Mail-Order Format | Does it look like direct response? | Use proven structure |
| 9. Results Focus | Are you testing, not guessing? | Set up A/B tests |
| 10. Discipline | Are you sticking to what works? | Cut distractions |

---

### Step 2: Structure Your Offer Using Threshold Resistance

**Low Threshold Offers** (Easy to accept):
- Free report/ebook
- Free checklist
- Free video training
- Free tool or calculator
- Information by mail/email

**High Threshold Offers** (Requires near-decision):
- Free consultation
- Free exam/assessment
- Free estimate
- Discounted first purchase
- Trial period

**Kennedy's Best Practice**: Include BOTH in every piece.

**Template:**
> "If you're ready to [solve problem] now, [High Threshold Offer - e.g., 'schedule your $49 assessment'].
>
> But if you're not quite sure yet, start with our free [Low Threshold Offer - e.g., 'report on the 7 Warning Signs of...']"

---

### Step 3: Create Urgency Without Being Sleazy

**Legitimate Urgency Tactics:**

1. **Limited Quantity**: "Only 17 spots available"
2. **Limited Time**: "Offer expires Friday at midnight"
3. **Limited Per Person**: "One per household"
4. **Bonus Deadline**: "Free bonus if you order by..."
5. **Price Increase**: "Price goes up Monday"
6. **Geographic Exclusivity**: "Only one client per zip code"
7. **Event-Based**: "Workshop is March 15th - can't be recorded"

**The Sloth Test:**
> "Imagine your prospect as a giant sloth on the couch, phone just out of reach. Does your urgency FORCE them to move NOW?"

If not, it's too weak.

---

### Step 4: Write Copy That Sells

**Kennedy's 4 Chief Copy Rules:**

**Rule 1: Write to the Psyche (Not the Product)**
```
❌ WRONG: "Our software has 47 features including..."
✅ RIGHT: "Imagine never staying late at the office again..."
```

Start from: customer's interests, desires, frustrations, fears
Journey to: your solution

**Rule 2: Write Emotionally, Not Professionally**
```
❌ WRONG: "We provide comprehensive financial planning services."
✅ RIGHT: "I was terrified I'd run out of money before I ran out of life."
```

Write like you talk. Use enthusiasm. Be conversational.

**Rule 3: Make Huge Claims**
```
❌ WRONG: "Our clients often see improvement."
✅ RIGHT: "Our clients routinely DOUBLE their income in 90 days."
```

> "Timid salesmen have skinny kids."

**Rule 4: Don't Just Shout Louder**

A weak message shouted louder is still weak. Fix the message first.

---

### Step 5: Build Your Follow-Up Sequence

**Kennedy's Follow-Up Framework:**

| Stage | Email | Focus |
|-------|-------|-------|
| 1 | Same Day | Deliver what was promised, set expectations |
| 2 | Day 2-3 | Re-state the offer, add testimonial |
| 3 | Day 5-7 | "2nd Notice" - new deadline, address objection |
| 4 | Day 10-14 | "Final Notice" - last chance, consequence of inaction |
| 5 | Day 21+ | Change the offer (different angle or product) |

**Key Insight:**
> "You pay for every website visit, every call, every walk-in. Doing nothing with one is like flushing money down the toilet."

---

### Step 6: Use the Results Triangle

Every campaign needs all three sides working together:

```
          MARKET (WHO)
         /            \
        /              \
MESSAGE (WHAT) ---- MEDIA (WHERE)
```

**Market Questions:**
- Who EXACTLY is my ideal customer?
- What do they read/watch/attend?
- Where do they congregate?

**Message Questions:**
- Does this speak to THEIR desires, not my features?
- Is it a "magnetic message" that feels written just for them?

**Media Questions:**
- Am I using channels where my market actually is?
- Am I diversified (not dependent on 1-2 channels)?

## Examples

### Example 1: Local Chiropractor Direct Mail

**BEFORE (Brand Advertising):**
> "Smith Chiropractic - Serving Our Community Since 1985
> We offer comprehensive chiropractic care.
> Call us today!"

**AFTER (Kennedy-Style Direct Response):**

**Headline:**
> "FREE REPORT: 7 Warning Signs Your Back Pain Will Get WORSE (And What to Do About It)"

**Body:**
> Dear Neighbor,
>
> If you've been waking up stiff, or wincing when you bend over to tie your shoes, I have to warn you: it probably won't get better on its own.
>
> In fact, according to a Johns Hopkins study, 80% of people who ignore early back pain end up with chronic problems within 5 years.
>
> I've put together a FREE report that reveals:
> - The 7 warning signs most people ignore
> - Why painkillers make the problem WORSE
> - The 3-minute morning stretch that prevents 60% of back problems
>
> **Two Ways to Get Help:**
>
> **Option 1**: If you're ready for relief NOW, call 555-1234 and mention "NEIGHBOR" to get a complete exam for just $29 (regularly $150). But hurry - I can only see 12 new patients this month at this price.
>
> **Option 2**: If you're not sure chiropractic is right for you, get my FREE report first. Just call the 24-hour recorded message at 555-5678 or visit BackPainReport.com/neighbor

**Tracking**: Unique phone numbers and URL for this campaign.

### Example 2: B2B Software Sales Letter

**Opening (Psyche-First):**
> "Last Tuesday at 11:47 PM, I was STILL at the office.
>
> My wife had texted three times. My daughter's soccer game was long over. And I was manually entering data into spreadsheets that should have been done hours ago.
>
> That's when I decided: enough is enough."

**The Offer Stack:**
> Here's everything you get:
> - Complete DataSync Pro license ($2,997 value)
> - 1-on-1 setup call with our team ($500 value)
> - 90-day email support ($297 value)
> - BONUS: "50 Time-Saving Templates" guide ($197 value)
>
> **Total Value: $3,991**
> **Your Investment Today: Just $997**

**Urgency:**
> "But I have to be honest with you: this price is only available until Friday.
>
> On Monday, we're raising the price to $1,497 - no exceptions.
>
> AND the first 25 people who order get a free 30-minute strategy call with me personally (a $500 value). As I write this, 18 spots are already taken."

**Clear Instructions:**
> "Here's what to do next:

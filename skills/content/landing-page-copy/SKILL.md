# Landing Page Copy

> Build high-converting landing pages with proven structure, persuasive sections, and best practices. From hero to footer—every element optimized.

## When to Use This Skill

- Writing landing pages from scratch
- Improving existing underperforming pages
- Creating templates for repeatable page types
- Structuring lead gen, sales, or product pages
- Reviewing pages for conversion optimization
- Building landing page copy briefs for designers

## Methodology Foundation

**Source**: Compiled from Unbounce research, CXL Institute studies, Copyhackers methodology, and direct response best practices.

**Core Principle**: A landing page has one job: get the visitor to take one action. Every element—headline, body, proof, CTA—must support that single conversion goal.

**Why This Matters**: Landing pages convert 5-15% on average. Top performers hit 25%+. The difference is almost always in the copy and structure, not the design.

---

### Section 1: The Hero

```
## Hero Section (Above the Fold)

The hero must answer 3 questions in <5 seconds:
1. What is this?
2. Who is it for?
3. Why should I care?

### Hero Elements

**Headline** (most important element)
- Clear primary benefit or transformation
- Specific, not vague
- Matches the ad/email that brought them here
- 10 words or fewer ideal

**Subheadline**
- Expands on the headline
- Adds specificity or mechanism
- Addresses WHO it's for
- 20-30 words max

**CTA Button**
- Primary action
- Value-focused text
- High contrast, prominent

**Visual**
- Product shot OR outcome visualization
- Happy user (if using people)
- Should reinforce the headline

**Supporting Microcopy**
- Below CTA: "No credit card required"
- Trust badges if relevant
- Quick wins: "2-min setup"

### Hero Template

```
[HEADLINE: Primary benefit in 10 words or less]

[SUBHEADLINE: Explain how they get that benefit, for whom, or what makes it unique]

[CTA BUTTON: Action + Value]

[Microcopy: Address main anxiety]
```

### Hero Examples

**SaaS Example:**
```
Headline: "Finally, a CRM salespeople actually use"
Subheadline: "Pipedrive automates busywork so you can focus on closing. Trusted by 100,000+ sales teams."
CTA: "Start Free Trial"
Microcopy: "No credit card • Setup in 5 minutes"
```

**Lead Gen Example:**
```
Headline: "The 7-Step Checklist That Tripled Our Email Opens"
Subheadline: "Stop guessing. Use the exact framework that grew our list from 0 to 50K."
CTA: "Get the Free Checklist"
Microcopy: "Sent instantly • No spam, unsubscribe anytime"
```
```

### Section 2: Problem/Pain

```
## Problem Section

**Purpose**: Show you understand their pain. Create resonance before presenting solution.

### Key Principles
- Use THEIR language (from research/reviews)
- Be specific, not generic
- Agitate but don't manipulate
- 3-5 pain points max
- Set up the solution

### Format Options

**Option A: Bullet List**
```
Sound familiar?
• [Pain point 1 in their words]
• [Pain point 2]

```

**Option B: "If you're like most..." Statement**
```
If you're like most [audience], you've probably...
- Tried [failed solution] and got nowhere

```

**Option C: Scenario**
```
Every Monday, the same thing happens.
[Describe painful scenario in vivid detail]
[Show the consequence]
[Hint at the cost]
```

### Problem Section Template

```
[HEADER: Question or "Sound familiar?"]

[3-5 specific pain points using customer language]

[TRANSITION: "It doesn't have to be this way" or "There's a better way"]
```
```

---

### Section 3: Solution

```

[1-2 sentences on what it does and why it matters]

### [Feature 2 Name]
[1-2 sentences]

### [Feature 3 Name]
[1-2 sentences]
```

### Features Template

```
## Everything you need to [achieve goal]

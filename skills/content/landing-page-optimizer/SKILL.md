## Methodology Foundation

**Sources:**
- Unbounce - "101 Landing Page Optimization Tips" by Oli Gardner
- Unbounce Landing Page Best Practices

---

## Instructions

### The Foundation: One Goal, One Message, One Action

Before optimizing anything, clarify:

| Question | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| What is the ONE action you want? | Define primary conversion goal |
| What is the ONE message? | Core value proposition |
| Who is the ONE audience? | Specific visitor segment |

Everything on the page must support this singular focus.

---

### Phase 1: Message Match

#### The Principle

Visitors arrive with expectations set by your ad or email. Your landing page must immediately confirm they're in the right place.

**Message match checklist:**

| Element | Ad/Email | Landing Page |
|---------|----------|--------------|
| Headline | Same or similar | Matches promise |
| Imagery | Consistent style | Same visual tone |
| Offer | Specific promise | Exact same offer |
| CTA | Action implied | Action delivered |

#### Common Message Match Failures

```
BAD: Ad says "50% off running shoes"
     → Landing page shows general shoe catalog

GOOD: Ad says "50% off running shoes"
      → Landing page shows running shoes with 50% off prominently displayed
```

**For multiple ads:** Use Dynamic Text Replacement to match ad copy to landing page headlines automatically.

---

### Phase 2: Above-the-Fold Optimization

#### What Must Appear Above the Fold

1. **Headline** - Clear value proposition
2. **Subheadline** - Supporting benefit or clarification
3. **Hero image/video** - Product in action or relevant visual
4. **Primary CTA** - Obvious, clickable button
5. **Trust indicator** - One proof point (optional but helpful)

#### Above-the-Fold Layout Template

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  [Logo]                    [Trust badge]│
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                         │
│  [HEADLINE - Main Value Proposition]    │
│                                         │
│  [Subheadline - Supporting benefit]     │
│                                         │
│  ┌─────────────────┐   ┌─────────────┐  │
│  │                 │   │ [Hero Image │  │
│  │   [CTA BUTTON]  │   │ or Video]   │  │
│  │                 │   │             │  │
│  └─────────────────┘   └─────────────┘  │
│                                         │
│  [Brief trust statement or social proof]│
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### The Five-Second Test

Show your page to someone for 5 seconds, then hide it. Ask:
- What was the page about?
- What was the main offer?
- What were you supposed to do?

If they can't answer clearly, your above-the-fold needs work.

---

### Phase 3: Copy Optimization

#### Headline Formulas

**Benefit-focused:**
```
[Get/Achieve] [Desired Outcome] [Without Common Pain Point]

Example: "Get More Qualified Leads Without Cold Calling"
```

**Problem-agitate:**
```
[Tired of/Struggling with] [Pain Point]? [Solution]

Example: "Tired of Landing Pages That Don't Convert? We Can Help"
```

**Specificity:**
```
[Specific Number] [People/Companies] [Achieved Specific Result]

Example: "12,847 Marketers Increased Conversions by 34%"
```

#### Body Copy Best Practices

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Short paragraphs (2-3 sentences) | Walls of text |
| Bullet points for benefits | Long, dense lists |
| "You" focused language | "We" focused language |
| Specific numbers and results | Vague claims |
| Action verbs | Passive voice |

#### The Krug Rule

> "Cut your copy in half, then throw away half of what's left."

If you can say it in fewer words, do it.

---

### Phase 4: CTA Optimization

#### CTA Copy Best Practices

**Be specific about what happens:**

| Weak CTA | Strong CTA |
|----------|------------|
| Submit | Get My Free Ebook |
| Click Here | Start My Free Trial |
| Learn More | See Pricing Plans |
| Download | Download the Checklist |
| Sign Up | Create My Account |

**Use first-person when possible:**
- "Start my free trial" vs. "Start your free trial"
- "Get my copy" vs. "Get your copy"

#### CTA Design Checklist

- [ ] **Contrasting color** - Stands out from page
- [ ] **Adequate size** - Easy to click/tap
- [ ] **Whitespace** - Breathing room around button
- [ ] **Above the fold** - Visible without scrolling
- [ ] **Repeated on long pages** - Every screen length
- [ ] **Looks clickable** - Button shape, depth, hover state

#### Button Color

Contrast matters more than specific color. The button should be the most visually prominent element on the page.

Test colors, but prioritize:
- High contrast with background
- Different from other page elements
- Consistent with (but stands out from) brand

---

### Phase 5: Form Optimization

#### The Friction Formula

More fields = More friction = Fewer conversions

#### Field Reduction Strategy

| Keep | Question | Remove |
|------|----------|--------|
| Name | Do you need first AND last? | Title, suffix |
| Email | Required for follow-up | Secondary email |
| Phone | Will you actually call? | Fax |
| Company | Essential for B2B qualification | Company size |
| Role | Helps with segmentation | Years experience |

**Rule of thumb:** For every field you add, ask "Will this information meaningfully improve our ability to serve this lead?"

#### Multi-Step Forms

For 5+ required fields, split into steps:

```
Step 1 (Easy):
- Name
- Email

Step 2 (Medium):
- Company
- Role

Step 3 (Sensitive):
- Budget
- Timeline
```

Start easy, progress to sensitive.

#### Form Design Best Practices

- Large, readable labels
- Single column layout (easier to scan)
- Clear error messages
- Progress indicators for multi-step
- Inline validation
- Mobile-friendly tap targets

---

### Phase 6: Trust Building

#### Trust Elements to Include

| Element | Use Case | Placement |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| **Testimonials** | B2B, services, courses | Near CTA or mid-page |
| **Customer logos** | B2B, enterprise | Above fold or footer |
| **Reviews/ratings** | E-commerce, SaaS | Near pricing/CTA |
| **Case study snippets** | B2B, high-ticket | Supporting content |
| **Security badges** | E-commerce, forms | Near form/checkout |
| **Guarantees** | E-commerce, courses | Near CTA |
| **Media mentions** | Brand building | Footer or trust bar |

#### Testimonial Best Practices

**Weak testimonial:**
> "Great product!" — J.S.

**Strong testimonial:**
> "We increased our conversion rate by 47% in the first month. The ROI paid for the annual subscription in two weeks." — Jane Smith, Marketing Director at Acme Corp [with photo]

Include:
- Full name and title
- Company name
- Specific results
- Photo (video even better)

#### Trust Killers to Avoid

- Generic stock photos (especially handshakes)
- Fake urgency ("Only 3 left!" when there are unlimited)
- Unverifiable claims
- Aggressive popups
- Spelling and grammar errors
- Broken links or images

---

### Phase 7: Visual Hierarchy and Design

#### Directional Cues

Guide the eye toward your CTA using:
- **Arrows** - Literal pointers
- **Eye gaze** - People in photos looking toward CTA
- **Lines and shapes** - Leading toward action area
- **Color contrast** - Making CTA pop
- **White space** - Framing important elements

#### Design Principles

| Principle | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| **F-pattern reading** | Put key info along top and left |
| **Z-pattern for images** | Eye moves diagonally across |
| **Contrast** | Make important elements pop |
| **Proximity** | Group related elements |
| **Alignment** | Create visual order |
| **Repetition** | Consistent styling throughout |

#### Mobile Optimization

83% of landing page visits are on mobile devices.

**Mobile checklist:**
- [ ] Single column layout
- [ ] Large, tappable buttons (44px minimum)
- [ ] Readable text without zooming
- [ ] Fast load time (<3 seconds)
- [ ] Simplified navigation
- [ ] Click-to-call phone numbers

---

### Phase 8: A/B Testing

#### Testing Hierarchy (Highest Impact First)

1. **Offer** - What you're selling
2. **Headline** - Main value proposition
3. **CTA** - Copy and design
4. **Hero image** - Visual impact
5. **Form length** - Number of fields
6. **Social proof** - Type and placement
7. **Page length** - Short vs. long form

#### Testing Best Practices

- Test one variable at a time
- Wait for statistical significance
- Document every test and result
- Have a hypothesis before testing
- Let winners inform future tests

#### What to Test

| Element | Variations to Try |
|---------|-------------------|
| Headline | Benefit vs. problem, short vs. long |
| CTA copy | Action words, first vs. second person |
| CTA color | High contrast options |
| Form | Fields, steps, layout |
| Images | Product shots, people, illustrations |
| Social proof | Testimonials, logos, reviews |
| Page length | Short vs. long form |

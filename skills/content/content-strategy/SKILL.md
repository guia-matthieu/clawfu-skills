## Instructions

### The Six Principles of Epic Content

Every piece of content should be evaluated against these principles:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              THE 6 PRINCIPLES OF EPIC CONTENT               │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                             │
│  1. FILL A NEED       Useful in itself, answers questions   │

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**The Ultimate Test**: Would your audience miss your content if it disappeared?

---

### Step 1: Define Your Content Niche

The narrower your niche, the easier it is to become the go-to resource.

**Bad Niche Examples**:
- "Marketing" (too broad)
- "Small business advice" (too broad)
- "Technology news" (too broad)

**Good Niche Examples**:
- "Email marketing for Shopify stores"
- "Pricing strategy for SaaS startups"
- "Adventure travel with small dogs"

**Finding Your Niche**:

| Question | Your Answer |
|----------|-------------|
| What topic could you create 100+ pieces about? | |
| Where does your expertise intersect with audience pain? | |
| What's underserved in your industry? | |
| Where are competitors NOT creating great content? | |
| What would you be excited to cover for years? | |

**The Niche Test**: Can you realistically become the #1 source on this topic?

---

### Step 2: Create Your Content Mission Statement

**The XYZ Method** (Andy Crestodina):

> "Our company is where **[Audience X]** finds **[Content Y]** for **[Benefit Z]**."

**Examples**:

| Business | Mission Statement |
|----------|-------------------|
| B2B SaaS | "Our company is where startup founders find actionable growth tactics to scale without burning out." |
| Financial Services | "Our company is where young professionals find practical money advice to build wealth before 40." |
| E-commerce | "Our company is where home chefs find tested recipes and techniques to cook restaurant-quality meals." |

**Mission Statement Worksheet**:

```markdown
## Content Mission Statement

### Audience (X)
Who are we creating content for?
- Primary persona:
- Their biggest challenge:
- What they're trying to achieve:

### Content (Y)
What type of content will we create?
- Format (blog, video, podcast, newsletter):
- Tone (educational, entertaining, inspiring):
- Depth (beginner, intermediate, expert):

### Benefit (Z)
What will they get from our content?
- Tangible outcome:
- Emotional benefit:
- Transformation:

### Final Mission Statement
"[Company] is where [Audience] finds [Content] for [Benefit]."
```

### Step 3: Plan Your Content Pillars

Content pillars are the 3-5 main topics that support your mission.

**Framework**:

```
                 CONTENT MISSION
                       |
       ┌───────────────┼───────────────┐
       |               |               |
   PILLAR 1        PILLAR 2        PILLAR 3
       |               |               |
   ┌───┴───┐       ┌───┴───┐       ┌───┴───┐
Topics  Topics  Topics  Topics  Topics  Topics
```

**Example: SaaS Marketing Company**

| Pillar | Topics Covered |
|--------|----------------|
| **Growth Tactics** | SEO, paid ads, content marketing, email |
| **Product Strategy** | Pricing, positioning, launches, roadmaps |
| **Team Building** | Hiring, culture, remote work, leadership |

**Pillar Planning Questions**:
1. What 3-5 categories cover 80% of your audience's questions?
2. Do you have expertise (or access to experts) in each pillar?
3. Can you create 20+ pieces per pillar annually?
4. Does each pillar connect to your products/services?

### Step 4: Map Content to the Buyer Journey

Different content serves different stages:

| Stage | Buyer State | Content Goal | Content Types |
|-------|-------------|--------------|---------------|
| **Awareness** | "I have a problem" | Educate, attract | Blog posts, social, podcasts, videos |
| **Consideration** | "What are my options?" | Nurture, differentiate | Guides, webinars, comparison content |
| **Decision** | "Is this right for me?" | Convert, prove value | Case studies, demos, trials, reviews |
| **Retention** | "Did I make the right choice?" | Delight, expand | Tutorials, community, exclusive content |

**Content Mapping Exercise**:

```markdown

### Step 5: Build Your Editorial Calendar

Consistency is the #1 factor in content success. An editorial calendar ensures you deliver.

**Minimum Viable Calendar**:

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Publish Date** | When it goes live |
| **Content Title** | Working headline |
| **Content Pillar** | Which pillar it supports |
| **Format** | Blog, video, podcast, etc. |
| **Target Persona** | Who it's for |
| **Buyer Stage** | Awareness, consideration, decision |
| **Author/Owner** | Who's responsible |
| **Status** | Idea, draft, review, scheduled, published |

**Cadence Recommendations**:

| Channel | Minimum Frequency | Ideal Frequency |
|---------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Blog | 1x/week | 2-4x/week |
| Newsletter | 1x/week | 1-2x/week |
| Podcast | 1x/week | 1x/week |
| YouTube | 1x/week | 2x/week |
| LinkedIn | 3x/week | Daily |

**Warning**: Don't commit to more than you can sustain. Consistency > frequency.

### Step 6: Build the Subscriber Hierarchy

Move your audience up the pyramid:

```
                    SUPERFANS
                   /         \
                  /  Advocates \
                 /   Share your  \
                /    content      \
               /___________________\
                   SUBSCRIBERS
                  /             \
                 / Email list,   \
                /  direct access  \
               /___________________\
                    FOLLOWERS
                   /           \
                  / Social media \
                 /  low engagement\
                /__________________\
                 CASUAL VISITORS
                /                 \
               / One-time readers  \
              /_____________________|
```

**Moving People Up**:

| Level | Tactic to Ascend |
|-------|------------------|
| Visitor → Follower | Social follow CTAs, shareable content |
| Follower → Subscriber | Lead magnets, exclusive content, newsletter value |
| Subscriber → Superfan | Community, recognition, insider access, exceptional value |

**Key Metric**: Track the conversion rate between levels monthly.

### Step 7: Measure What Matters

**The Three-Factor Score** (Jessica Bergmann, Salesforce):
1. Did you bring in the right audiences?
2. Did you keep them engaged?
3. Did you move them to a next step?

**What C-Suite Cares About**:

| Question | How to Measure |
|----------|----------------|
| Is content driving sales? | Sales lift analysis, attributed revenue |
| Is content saving costs? | Support ticket reduction, self-service usage |
| Is content helping retention? | NPS scores, renewal rates for content consumers |
| Is content growing our community? | Subscriber growth, engagement trends |

**Content Metrics Framework**:

| Level | Metrics | Purpose |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **Consumption** | Page views, downloads, listens | Are people finding it? |
| **Engagement** | Time on page, scroll depth, comments | Are they consuming it? |
| **Sharing** | Social shares, forwards, referrals | Are they spreading it? |
| **Lead Generation** | Email signups, form fills | Are they converting? |
| **Sales** | Pipeline influenced, revenue attributed | Is it driving business? |

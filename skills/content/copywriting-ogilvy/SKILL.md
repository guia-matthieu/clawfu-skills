## Instructions

When applying Ogilvy's methods, follow these 7 core principles:

### The 7 Ogilvy Principles

```
## Principle 1: GIVE THE FACTS

**The Rule**: Present all relevant facts about your product. Facts sell.

**Ogilvy**: "The more facts you tell, the more you sell. An advertisement's chance for success invariably increases as the number of pertinent merchandise facts included in the advertisement increases."

**Application**:
- Don't be vague—be specific
- Include specifications, data, details
- Don't assume "boring" facts aren't interesting
- Benefits matter, but FACTS prove them

**Bad**: "Our software is fast"
**Good**: "Our software processes 10,000 transactions per second—4x faster than the industry average"

**Bad**: "High-quality ingredients"
**Good**: "Made with 100% Arabica beans from the Cerrado region of Brazil, roasted within 72 hours of shipping"

---

## Principle 2: BE TRUTHFUL

**The Rule**: Never lie. Ever.

**Ogilvy**: "Never write an advertisement which you wouldn't want your own family to read. You wouldn't tell lies to your own wife. Don't tell them to mine."

**Application**:
- Avoid superlatives you can't prove
- Never exaggerate results
- If you have to hedge, hedge honestly
- Good products CAN be sold honestly

**Words to Avoid** (unless provable):
- "Best"
- "Revolutionary"
- "World's first"
- "Guaranteed" (unless it actually is)
- "Unique" (rarely true)

**Words That Work**:
- Specific numbers
- Verifiable claims
- Honest comparisons
- Real customer quotes

---

## Principle 3: BE HELPFUL

**The Rule**: Give value. Help the reader solve problems.

**Ogilvy**: "Another profitable gambit is to give the reader helpful advice, or service. It hooks about 75 per cent more readers than copy which deals entirely with the product."

**Application**:
- Lead with useful information
- Teach something before selling
- Position product as helper, not hero
- Content marketing before content marketing existed

**Structure Template**:
1. Open with helpful insight
2. Explain the principle
3. Show how product applies the principle
4. CTA

---

## Principle 4: HAVE A BIG IDEA

**The Rule**: Center everything around one powerful concept.

**Ogilvy**: "Unless your campaign contains a Big Idea, it will pass like a ship in the night."

**Warning**: "Most campaigns are too complicated. They reflect a long list of objectives, and try to reconcile the divergent views of too many executives. By attempting to cover too many things, they achieve nothing."

**Big Idea Criteria**:
- Simple enough for a child to understand
- Memorable after one exposure
- Can sustain years of campaigning
- Differentiates meaningfully

**Examples**:
- Snickers: "You're not you when you're hungry"
- Avis: "We try harder" (because we're #2)
- Rolls-Royce: "At 60 mph, the loudest noise comes from the electric clock"

---

## Principle 5: DON'T BE BORING

**The Rule**: Be interesting. But interesting that SELLS.

**Ogilvy**: "You cannot bore people into buying your product; you can only interest them in buying it."

**How to Be Interesting**:
- Know your customer deeply
- Find the fascinating angle in every fact
- Use storytelling when appropriate
- Write like a human, not a corporation

**Warning**: Don't confuse entertaining with effective.

**Ogilvy**: "Good copywriters have always resisted the temptation to entertain."

The goal is INTERESTING, not merely entertaining. Everything should drive toward the sale.

---

## Principle 6: UNDERSTAND YOUR CUSTOMER

**The Rule**: Know who you're talking to. Respect them.

**Ogilvy**: "The consumer is not a moron. She is your wife. Don't insult her intelligence."

**Application**:
- Write in their language
- Address their real concerns
- Never condescend
- Never use jargon they don't use
- Men shouldn't write ads for women's products (without research)

**Before Writing, Know**:
- What keeps them up at night?
- What language do they use?
- What do they already know?
- What would make them feel understood?

---

## Principle 7: STAY TRUE TO YOUR BRAND

**The Rule**: Build consistent personality over time.

**Ogilvy**: "Every advertisement should be thought of as a contribution to the complex symbol which is the brand image."

**Warning**: "Most manufacturers are reluctant to accept any limitation on the image of their brand. They want it to be all things to all people … They generally end up with a brand which has no personality of any kind, a wishy-washy neuter."

**Application**:
- Define brand personality clearly
- Apply it consistently across all touchpoints
- Accept limitations—you can't be everything
- Build equity over years, not campaigns

**Ogilvy on Originality**: "Nobody has ever built a brand by imitating somebody else's advertising."
```

### Ogilvy Headline Rules

```
## Headlines: 80% of Your Ad's Success

**Ogilvy**: "On the average, five times as many people read the headline as read the body copy. When you have written your headline, you have spent eighty cents out of your dollar."

### The Rules

1. **Include your selling promise**
   Bad: "Introducing the new XR-7"
   Good: "At 60 mph, the loudest noise in this Rolls-Royce comes from the electric clock"

2. **Appeal to self-interest**
   Bad: "Our award-winning formula"
   Good: "How to win friends and influence people"

3. **Announce news when possible**
   Bad: "Quality you can trust"
   Good: "New formula removes stains in half the time"

4. **Avoid blind headlines**
   Bad: "Think different" (needs body copy to make sense)
   Good: "Do you make these mistakes in English?" (complete idea)

5. **Use specifics over generalities**
   Bad: "Save money on car insurance"
   Good: "Save $423 on car insurance in 12 minutes"

6. **Never use negatives**
   Bad: "Don't miss this opportunity"
   Good: "Seize this opportunity today"

7. **Avoid puns and literary allusions**
   Bad: "A tale of two cities... and two prices"
   Good: "Same product. Half the price."

8. **Include the brand name**
   If people only read the headline, they should know who's talking.

### Ogilvy Headline Formulas

**The How-To**:
"How to [achieve desired outcome]"
"How I [achieved result] in [timeframe]"

**The Specific Number**:
"[Number] ways to [achieve outcome]"
"[Specific result] in [specific timeframe]"

**The News Angle**:
"Introducing: [new thing]"
"Announcing: [improvement]"
"Now you can [do something previously impossible]"

**The Question**:
"Do you [have common problem]?"
"What would you do with [benefit]?"

**The Command**:
"[Action verb] your way to [benefit]"
"Stop [bad thing]. Start [good thing]."
```

### Ogilvy Body Copy Style

```
## Long Copy That Sells

**Ogilvy on Copy Length**: "All my experience says that for a great many products, long copy sells more than short."

**Why Long Copy Works**:
- Gives facts that build conviction
- Answers objections before they arise
- Demonstrates expertise
- The interested reader wants more

### The Ogilvy Style

**Conversational but Expert**:
- Write like talking to a friend
- But a friend who's done their research
- Use "you" liberally
- Avoid corporate-speak

**Factual but Fascinating**:
- Every paragraph should teach something
- Numbers, percentages, specifics
- But presented in engaging way

**Structured for Scanning**:
- Use subheads generously
- First line of each paragraph must compel
- Key points should be skimmable

### Body Copy Template (Ogilvy Style)

```
[HEADLINE: Specific benefit or news]

[SUBHEAD: Expand on headline]

[OPENING: Hook with surprising fact or question]

[PROBLEM: Acknowledge the reader's situation]

[SOLUTION: Introduce your approach]

[MECHANISM: How it works (with specifics)]

[PROOF: Facts, numbers, testimonials]

[OBJECTION HANDLING: Address concerns]

[OFFER: What they get]

[CTA: Clear next step]
```
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Ogilvy's Famous Rolls-Royce Ad

**Headline**: "At 60 miles an hour the loudest noise in this new Rolls-Royce comes from the electric clock"

**Why It Works (Against the 7 Principles)**:

| Principle | How It's Applied |
|-----------|------------------|
| Facts | Specific claim about noise at specific speed |
| Truthful | Verifiable, based on real testing |
| Big Idea | One memorable image that says "quiet = quality" |
| Not Boring | Unexpected, makes you think |
| Respects Customer | Assumes intelligence, no hyperbole |
| Brand True | Consistent with Rolls-Royce prestige |

**Body Copy Approach**:
The ad then listed 13 specific facts about the car's engineering. No superlatives—just facts that demonstrated quality.

---

### Example 2: Modern Application - SaaS Product

**Instead of**: "The world's best project management tool"

**Ogilvy Style**: "Teams using Taskflow complete projects 37% faster—here's the one change they made"

**Body Copy Opening**:
"Most project managers spend 4.2 hours per week on status updates. That's 218 hours per year—five and a half work weeks—just tracking who's doing what.

We studied 847 teams to find out what the fastest ones do differently. The answer surprised us..."

[Then: facts, specifics, proof, mechanism, offer]

---

### Example 3: Ogilvy Headline Transformation

**Original Headlines → Ogilvy Rewrites**:

| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| "Revolutionary new software" | "Software that reduced deployment time from 4 hours to 4 minutes" |
| "Best coffee in town" | "Roasted this morning. Shipped this afternoon. In your cup by tomorrow." |
| "Quality you can trust" | "47 inspections before it leaves the factory" |
| "Affordable prices" | "Same ingredients as the $80 cream. $24." |
| "Customer-focused service" | "We answer the phone in 42 seconds (we've timed it)" |

# Purple Cow Marketing - Stand Out or Be Invisible

> Create remarkable products and experiences that spread through word of mouth using Seth Godin's Purple Cow methodology

## When to Use This Skill

- **Launching a new product** and need it to stand out in a crowded market
- **Differentiating your brand** from competitors who all look the same
- **Escaping commodity status** where you compete only on price
- **Planning a marketing strategy** with limited advertising budget

## Methodology Foundation

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Source** | Purple Cow: Transform Your Business by Being Remarkable (2003) |
| **Expert** | Seth Godin - Marketing pioneer, bestselling author of 20+ books, founder of Yoyodyne and Squidoo |
| **Core Principle** | "In a crowded marketplace, fitting in is failing. In a busy marketplace, not standing out is the same as being invisible. You're either remarkable or invisible." |


## What Claude Does vs What You Decide

| Claude Does | You Decide |
|-------------|------------|
| Structures production workflow | Final creative direction |
| Suggests technical approaches | Equipment and tool choices |
| Creates templates and checklists | Quality standards |
| Identifies best practices | Brand/voice decisions |
| Generates script outlines | Final script approval |

## What This Skill Does

This skill helps you escape the trap of average. Instead of trying to out-advertise competitors, you create something worth talking about—a Purple Cow.

You'll learn to:

1. **Identify what's remarkable** - Find the Purple Cow in your product or create one
2. **Avoid the safe middle** - Go to the edges where remarkable lives
3. **Find your sneezers** - Target people who spread ideas, not the masses
4. **Design for word of mouth** - Make your remarkable thing easy to share
5. **Escape advertising dependency** - Let the product market itself

The result: A product or service so remarkable that customers do your marketing for you.

## How to Use

### Prompt Examples

```
Analyze my product/service for Purple Cow potential. Here's what we offer: [description].
What's remarkable? What's invisible? How could we become a Purple Cow in our category?
```

```

```

```

**The Core Truth**: Traditional advertising is broken. Consumers ignore ads, skip commercials, and suffer from information overload. The only way to cut through is to be remarkable—worth making a remark about.

---

### Step 1: Understand What "Remarkable" Really Means

Remarkable = Worth making a remark about

**Remarkable is NOT:**
- Being weird for weird's sake
- Being shocking or offensive
- Being the cheapest
- Having the most features
- Being "different" without purpose

**Remarkable IS:**
- Solving a real problem in an unexpected way
- Delighting customers so much they tell others
- Standing out to the people who matter (your target)
- Creating an experience worth sharing

**The Remarkable Test:**

| Question | If Yes | If No |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Would someone tell a friend about this? | ✓ Remarkable potential | Invisible |
| Would a stranger stop and ask about it? | ✓ Remarkable potential | Invisible |
| Does it make people say "Wow!" or "Huh, interesting"? | ✓ Remarkable potential | Invisible |
| Is it worth taking a photo to share? | ✓ Remarkable potential | Invisible |
| Would your customers miss it if it disappeared? | ✓ Remarkable | Commodity |

---

### Step 2: Go to the Edges

**The Danger Zone**: The safe middle is where products go to die. "Good enough" is invisible.

```
    THE EDGE SPECTRUM

    ←── EDGE ─────────── MIDDLE ─────────── EDGE ──→

    Remarkable         Safe/Invisible        Remarkable
    (Risky)            (Competing on price)  (Risky)

    "In a world of too many choices, the safest thing is to be risky."
```

**Finding Your Edge:**

| Dimension | Safe Middle (Invisible) | Edge Options (Remarkable) |
|-----------|------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Price** | Competitive | Free OR 10x more expensive |
| **Features** | Industry standard | Radically simple OR incredibly comprehensive |
| **Design** | Professional/expected | Wildly distinctive |
| **Service** | Adequate | Outrageously personal OR fully self-service |
| **Speed** | Same-day | Instant OR worth waiting for |
| **Audience** | Everyone | Tiny niche obsessed with your thing |
| **Personality** | Corporate neutral | Bold, opinionated, human |

**Edge Exercise:**
For each dimension, ask: "What would happen if we went to the extreme?"

---

### Step 3: Find Your Sneezers

**The Adoption Curve Mistake**: Most companies market to the majority. By the time the majority cares, you're a commodity.

    │  (They spread ideas)                                   │
    └────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Sneezers**: People who spread your idea like a virus.

| Sneezer Type | Characteristics | Strategy |
|--------------|-----------------|----------|
| **Promiscuous Sneezers** | Tell everyone about everything, high volume, lower influence per share | Make sharing frictionless, give them content |
| **Powerful Sneezers** | Selective, high credibility, fewer but more impactful recommendations | Create something worthy of their reputation |

**Finding Sneezers:**
1. Who actively seeks out new things in your category?
2. Who do others ask for recommendations?
3. Who has a platform or audience?
4. Who has "otaku" (obsessive interest) in your space?

---

### Step 4: Find the Otaku

**Otaku** (Japanese): An obsessive, all-consuming interest in something specific.

People with otaku for your category:
- Care deeply about details others ignore
- Spend disproportionate time and money
- Influence others in that niche
- Actively seek the remarkable
- Are forgiving of flaws if the remarkable part delivers

**Your Job**: Find people with otaku for your category, then give them something worth obsessing about.

**Examples of Otaku:**
- Audiophiles (hi-fi equipment)
- Sneakerheads (rare shoes)
- Coffee aficionados (single-origin beans)
- Mechanical keyboard enthusiasts
- Craft beer geeks

**Question**: Who obsesses about what you sell? What would make them lose their minds with excitement?

---

### Step 5: Design for Word of Mouth

Your remarkable thing must be:

| Requirement | Test Question |
|-------------|---------------|
| **Easy to explain** | Can someone describe it in one sentence? |
| **Visible** | Can others see it, use it, experience it? |
| **Worth the social risk** | Is recommending it worth their reputation? |
| **Shareable** | Is there a natural moment to share? |
| **Memorable** | Will they remember it tomorrow? Next week? |

**Word-of-Mouth Design Checklist:**
- [ ] One-sentence pitch that anyone can repeat
- [ ] Visual element that's photo/screenshot worthy
- [ ] Story hook that's fun to tell
- [ ] Built-in reason to mention (surprise, delight, status)
- [ ] No barriers to sharing (complicated name, hard to find, etc.)

---

### Step 6: The Purple Cow Creation Process

```
    1. IDENTIFY           2. EDGE              3. SNEEZERS
    What could be    →    Go extreme in    →   Who will
    remarkable?           that dimension       spread this?
         │                     │                    │
         ▼                     ▼                    ▼
    4. DESIGN            5. TEST              6. RELEASE
    Make it easy    →    Does it pass    →   Let the
    to spread            the tests?           sneezers work
```

**Process Details:**

**1. Identify**: What aspect of your product/service could be remarkable?
- Audit everything you do
- Look for the one thing you could be best at
- Find the dimension that matters most to sneezers

**2. Edge**: Go extreme in that dimension
- Not 10% better—10x better or radically different
- Accept you'll alienate some people
- Double down, don't hedge

**3. Sneezers**: Target the people who spread
- Ignore the masses initially
- Focus resources on innovators and early adopters
- Give them reasons to talk

**4. Design**: Make it spreadable
- One-sentence pitch
- Visual/shareable element
- Remove friction

**5. Test**: Does it pass the remarkable tests?
- Would they tell a friend?
- Would they miss it?
- Is it genuinely worth remarking about?

**6. Release**: Let word of mouth work
- Seed with sneezers
- Don't over-market
- Listen and iterate

## Examples

### Example 1: Mailchimp's Early Growth

**Situation**: Email marketing software in a crowded market (Constant Contact, AWeber, etc.).

**Purple Cow Analysis:**

**What was remarkable:**
- Free tier for small lists (radical pricing)
- Fun, irreverent brand voice (not corporate)
- Chimp mascot and animations (visual distinctiveness)
- "Send a friend a campaign" feature (built-in virality)

**The Edge They Chose:**
| Dimension | Competitors | Mailchimp |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| Price | Paid only | Free up to 2,000 subscribers |
| Tone | Corporate, serious | Fun, weird, human |
| Visual | Professional/boring | Quirky chimp, playful design |
| Complexity | Feature-heavy | Simple, focused |

**Who Were the Sneezers:**
- Bloggers and small creators
- Startup founders
- Web designers recommending tools to clients

**Why It Spread:**
- Free to try = no barrier
- Fun brand = fun to talk about
- "Powered by Mailchimp" footer = visibility
- High-fives after campaigns = shareable moment

**Result**: From underdog to market leader, acquired by Intuit for $12B.

---

### Example 2: RXBAR's Transparent Packaging

**Situation**: Protein bar market dominated by brands with confusing ingredient lists and health-washing marketing.

**Purple Cow Analysis:**

**What was remarkable:**
- Ingredients listed directly on the front of the package
- "No B.S." messaging
- Simple, bold typography
- Radical transparency in a category full of deception

**The Edge They Chose:**
| Dimension | Competitors | RXBAR |
|-----------|-------------|-------|
| Packaging | Marketing claims | Ingredient list as design |
| Messaging | "Healthy" | "3 Egg Whites, 6 Almonds, 4 Cashews..." |
| Complexity | 30+ ingredients | 5-6 real foods |
| Position | Health brand | Honesty brand |

**Who Were the Sneezers:**
- CrossFit community (otaku for clean eating)
- Fitness influencers tired of supplement BS
- Whole Foods shoppers reading every label

**Why It Spread:**
- Visible on the shelf = instant differentiation
- Easy to explain = "It just lists the ingredients on the front"
- CrossFit community = tight-knit, influential sneezers
- Aligned with values = worth the social capital to recommend

**Result**: From $2M to $160M revenue in 5 years, acquired by Kellogg's for $600M.

---

### Example 3: Service Business Purple Cow

**Situation**: A local accounting firm wanting to stand out from dozens of similar firms.

**Conventional Approach (Invisible):**
- Professional website with stock photos
- "Trusted, experienced, reliable" messaging
- Competitive pricing
- Generic service offerings

**Purple Cow Approach:**

| Edge Option | The Remarkable Thing |
|-------------|---------------------|
| **Radical Transparency** | Publish all pricing online, guarantee quotes in 24 hours |
| **Extreme Niche** | "Accountants for OnlyFans Creators" (real business) |
| **Radical Service** | Tax returns done in 48 hours, or they're free |
| **Personality** | "The accounting firm that actually replies to emails" |
| **Specialization** | Only serve restaurants, know every deduction |

**Implementation Example (Niche Strategy):**

**Target**: E-commerce sellers on Shopify

**Remarkable Elements:**
- Direct Shopify integration (pulls data automatically)
- E-commerce-specific tax optimization checklist
- "Shopify Store Financial Health Report" (free lead magnet)
- Community Slack for Shopify sellers
- Case studies with real revenue numbers

**Sneezers**: Shopify podcasters, e-commerce Facebook group admins, Shopify app developers

**Why It Would Spread:**
- Easy to explain: "They only do Shopify stores"
- Visible expertise: Content specifically for e-commerce
- Worth recommending: Saves money through specialized knowledge
- Natural moment: Tax season conversations in communities

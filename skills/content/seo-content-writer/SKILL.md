## Instructions

### Phase 1: Keyword Research & Opportunity Assessment

#### Finding Keywords Worth Targeting

Before writing, ensure people are actually searching for your topic.

**Keyword evaluation criteria:**

| Factor | What to Look For |
|--------|------------------|
| **Search volume** | Monthly searches (varies by niche) |
| **Keyword difficulty** | Can you realistically rank? |
| **Business relevance** | Does it connect to your offering? |
| **Search intent match** | Can you satisfy what searchers want? |
| **Traffic potential** | Total opportunity including related terms |

#### Quick Keyword Qualification

Ask these questions:
- Does this keyword have search volume?
- Can I create content better than what currently ranks?
- Will this traffic benefit my business?
- Do I have (or can I develop) expertise on this topic?

---

### Phase 2: Search Intent Analysis

#### Understanding What Searchers Want

Search intent is the "why" behind a query. Misaligning with intent means you won't rank, regardless of content quality.

**The Four Types of Search Intent:**

| Intent | User Goal | Content Format |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| **Informational** | Learn something | Blog posts, guides, how-tos |
| **Navigational** | Find a specific page | Brand pages, homepage |
| **Commercial** | Research before buying | Comparisons, reviews, "best of" |
| **Transactional** | Make a purchase | Product pages, pricing pages |

#### How to Analyze Intent

1. **Google the keyword** - Look at what currently ranks
2. **Identify the dominant format** - Listicle? Guide? Video?
3. **Note common elements** - What do all top results include?
4. **Find the content gap** - What's missing?

**Intent alignment checklist:**
- [ ] Does my content format match top results?
- [ ] Am I answering the same core question?
- [ ] Do I cover the same subtopics?
- [ ] Am I at the same depth level?

---

### Phase 3: E-E-A-T Planning

#### Building Trust Signals Into Your Content

Google evaluates content on four dimensions:

| Component | Definition | How to Demonstrate |
|-----------|------------|-------------------|
| **Experience** | First-hand involvement with topic | Personal stories, original photos, case studies |
| **Expertise** | Knowledge and skill in the field | Credentials, detailed explanations, accuracy |
| **Authoritativeness** | Recognition as a leading source | Backlinks, mentions, awards, industry presence |
| **Trustworthiness** | Accuracy, honesty, reliability | Citations, transparency, updated info, reviews |

#### E-E-A-T Content Tactics

**For Experience:**
- Include personal anecdotes relevant to the topic
- Use original images and screenshots
- Reference specific situations you've encountered
- Share results you've personally achieved

**For Expertise:**
- Add detailed author bio with credentials
- Include "Reviewed by" expert validation for YMYL topics
- Cite specific data, studies, and sources
- Demonstrate deep understanding (not surface-level)

**For Authoritativeness:**
- Link to and cite authoritative sources
- Reference your own original research
- Mention relevant credentials or experience
- Include expert quotes or interviews

**For Trustworthiness:**
- Provide accurate, fact-checked information
- Update content when information changes
- Be transparent about limitations or caveats
- Include proper citations and references

---

### Phase 4: Content Outline Creation

#### Building a Comprehensive Structure

Your outline should include:

1. **Working title** (optimize later)
2. **Target keyword** and related keywords
3. **Search intent summary**
4. **Unique angle** (what makes your content different)
5. **H2 sections** covering all subtopics searchers expect
6. **H3 subsections** for detailed breakdowns
7. **Key points** to cover in each section
8. **Original elements** (data, examples, case studies)

#### Finding Subtopics to Cover

Comprehensive content covers what searchers expect. Find subtopics by:

1. **Analyzing competitor content** - What do top pages include?
2. **Reviewing "People Also Ask"** - Common questions to answer
3. **Checking related searches** - Additional angles to cover
4. **Using content gap analysis** - Keywords competitors rank for

#### Outline Template

```
# [Working Title with Keyword]

Target Keyword: [primary keyword]
Secondary Keywords: [list 3-5]
Search Intent: [informational/commercial/etc.]
Unique Angle: [what makes this different]

## Introduction
- Hook

### Phase 5: Writing Optimized Content

#### The Writing Process

**Step 1: First Draft**
Write freely without perfectionism. Focus on:
- Getting all ideas out
- Following your outline
- Maintaining your unique angle

**Step 2: Optimization Pass**
Ensure SEO elements are in place:
- Primary keyword in first 100 words
- Keywords used naturally throughout
- Proper header structure (H1 → H2 → H3)
- Sufficient depth on each section

**Step 3: Readability Pass**
Make content easy to consume:
- Short paragraphs (2-4 sentences)
- Bullet points and numbered lists
- Tables for comparing information
- Visual breaks every 300-400 words

#### Writing Best Practices

| Do This | Avoid This |
|---------|------------|
| Write in active voice | Passive constructions |
| Use "you" directly | Third-person distance |
| Break up long sections | Walls of text |
| Include specific examples | Vague generalizations |
| Define technical terms | Unexplained jargon |
| Show, don't just tell | Abstract claims without proof |

#### Content Quality Checklist

- [ ] Does it fully answer the searcher's question?
- [ ] Is it more comprehensive than competitors?
- [ ] Does it include original insights or data?
- [ ] Is the information accurate and current?
- [ ] Would an expert approve of this content?
- [ ] Is it actually helpful to the reader?

### Phase 6: On-Page Optimization

#### Title Tag

The most important on-page element.

**Best practices:**
- Include primary keyword (preferably near the beginning)
- Keep under 60 characters
- Make it compelling (not just keyword-stuffed)
- Match search intent
- Stand out from competitors

**Title tag formulas:**

```
[Number] [Adjective] Ways to [Desired Outcome]
How to [Achieve Result] in [Timeframe]
[Topic]: The Complete Guide for [Year]
[Topic] vs [Topic]: [Angle]
What Is [Topic]? [Benefit or Hook]
```

#### Meta Description

Doesn't directly impact rankings but affects click-through rate.

**Best practices:**
- Stay under 155-160 characters
- Include primary keyword naturally
- Add a call-to-action
- Expand on the title (don't repeat it)
- Address the searcher directly

**Meta description template:**
```
Learn [what they'll learn]. This guide covers [key topics]
to help you [achieve outcome]. [CTA like "Read more" or "Get started"].
```

#### Header Structure

Proper header hierarchy helps both users and Google understand your content.

```
H1: Main Title (only one per page)
  H2: Major Section 1
    H3: Subsection
    H3: Subsection
  H2: Major Section 2
    H3: Subsection
  H2: Major Section 3
```

**Header tips:**
- Include keywords naturally (not forced)
- Make headers descriptive and specific
- Use headers to enable scanning
- Front-load important words

#### URL Structure

- Keep short and descriptive
- Include primary keyword
- Use hyphens between words
- Avoid dates (unless news content)
- Remove unnecessary words (a, the, and)

**Good:** `/seo-content-writing-guide/`
**Bad:** `/2024/01/15/the-ultimate-guide-to-writing-seo-content-for-your-blog/`

---

### Phase 7: Internal Linking

#### Why Internal Links Matter

- Help Google discover and understand new pages
- Pass link equity to important pages
- Keep users engaged on your site
- Build topical clusters

#### Internal Linking Best Practices

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Link from relevant context | Force unnatural links |
| Use descriptive anchor text | Use "click here" |
| Link to related content | Link to random pages |
| Update old posts with links to new | Forget about older content |
| Prioritize important pages | Spread links equally |

#### After Publishing Checklist

- [ ] Add internal links from existing relevant content
- [ ] Link to related posts within the new content
- [ ] Update pillar pages to reference new content
- [ ] Check that important pages have sufficient internal links

---

### Phase 8: E-E-A-T Review

#### Final Quality Check

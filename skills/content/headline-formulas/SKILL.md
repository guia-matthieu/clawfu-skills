# Headline Formulas

## When to Use This Skill

- Writing headlines for landing pages, ads, or articles
- Creating email subject lines that get opens

## Methodology Foundation

**Source**: Compiled from David Ogilvy, John Caples, Gary Halbert, Joanna Wiebe, and decades of tested direct response advertising.

**Core Principle**: "On the average, five times as many people read the headline as read the body copy." (Ogilvy) Your headline is 80% of your ad's success.

**Why This Matters**: A great product with a weak headline fails. A decent product with a magnetic headline succeeds. Headlines are the highest-leverage words you'll write.

## Skill Boundaries (Frontier Recognition)

### This skill excels for:
- Landing page headlines where one line determines conversion
- Email subject lines needing variety for A/B testing
- Ad copy generation (Facebook, Google, LinkedIn)
- Content headlines for articles and blog posts
- Social media hooks that stop the scroll

### This skill is NOT ideal for:
- **Brand taglines** (longer-term, needs brand strategy context) → Use brand-strategy skill first
- **Technical documentation** headlines → These follow different conventions
- **Headlines requiring specific legal language** → Requires human/legal review
- **Very niche B2B** where formulas feel too "marketingy" → Adapt tone or use softer formulas

### Quality Checkpoints

Before publishing, verify:
- [ ] Headline is specific to YOUR product (couldn't be used by competitor)
- [ ] Key benefit appears in first 6 words (for mobile/truncation)
- [ ] No unsubstantiated claims you can't prove
- [ ] Matches the actual content/offer (no bait-and-switch)
- [ ] Sounds like something a human would say

## Iteration Guide

> "The first batch is raw material. Polish through iteration."

### Recommended Iteration Pattern

| Pass | Focus | Questions to Ask |
|------|-------|------------------|
| **1st** | Volume | "Give me 15 headlines using different formulas" |
| **2nd** | Selection | "Which 5 have strongest hooks? Why?" |
| **3rd** | Refinement | "Make these more specific to [audience detail]" |
| **4th** | Testing | "Create 3 variations of the winner for A/B" |

### Useful Follow-up Prompts

After the first batch, try:
- "These feel generic. Add [specific product benefit or stat]"
- "Too salesy. Make them more conversational/editorial"
- "The audience is [sophisticated/skeptical]. Tone down the hype"
- "Create 5 more using ONLY the Question formula"
- "Shorten these to under 8 words for mobile"

---

## Learning Curve

| Usage | What You'll Experience |
|-------|----------------------|
| **1st use** | Discover the formula categories, get 15+ options fast |
| **5th use** | You develop favorites, request specific formula types |
| **20th use** | You internalize formulas, use Claude mainly for speed/variety |

**Pro tip**: Keep a swipe file of headlines that worked. Feed Claude your best performers as examples for even better results.

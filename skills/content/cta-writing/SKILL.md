# CTA Writing

> Master the art of calls-to-action that convert. Direct CTAs, transitional CTAs, button copy, and microcopy that turns readers into customers.

## When to Use This Skill

- Writing button text for landing pages and emails
- Creating CTAs for different stages of awareness
- Designing click-worthy microcopy
- A/B testing CTA variations
- Building email sequences with graduated CTAs
- Reducing friction at conversion points

## Methodology Foundation

**Source**: Compiled from direct response advertising, CRO research, and modern SaaS best practices (Joanna Wiebe, Unbounce, CXL Institute studies).

**Core Principle**: A CTA isn't just a button—it's the bridge between desire and action. Great CTAs complete the thought: "I want to ______."

**Why This Matters**: Your page can do everything right, but if the CTA fails, the conversion fails. CTAs are the single most tested element in conversion optimization for a reason.


## What Claude Does vs What You Decide

| Claude Does | You Decide |
|-------------|------------|
| Structures production workflow | Final creative direction |
| Suggests technical approaches | Equipment and tool choices |
| Creates templates and checklists | Quality standards |
| Identifies best practices | Brand/voice decisions |
| Generates script outlines | Final script approval |

## What This Skill Does

1. **Writes high-converting CTAs** - Button text that gets clicked
2. **Matches CTA to funnel stage** - Right ask at the right time
3. **Creates CTA variations** - A/B test candidates
4. **Crafts transitional CTAs** - Lower-commitment alternatives
5. **Writes supporting microcopy** - Text around the CTA that reduces friction

## How to Use

### Generate CTAs
```
Write 10 CTAs for:
Product: [description]
Page goal: [signup, purchase, demo, etc.]
Audience awareness: [unaware, problem-aware, solution-aware, product-aware, most-aware]
```

### Transitional CTAs
```
Create low-commitment CTAs for cold traffic:
Product: [description]
Ultimate goal: [final conversion]
```

### CTA + Microcopy
```
Write CTA button text plus supporting microcopy for:
Page: [landing page, pricing page, checkout, etc.]
Main objection to overcome: [objection]
```

### A/B Test Variations
```
Generate 10 CTA variations for testing:
Current CTA: [current text]
Conversion goal: [what success looks like]
```

## Instructions

When crafting CTAs, apply these frameworks:

### CTA Fundamentals

```
## The 3 CTA Types

### 1. DIRECT CTAs (High Commitment)
Request immediate action toward the main goal.
- "Buy Now"
- "Start Free Trial"
- "Book a Demo"
- "Get Instant Access"

**Use when**: Audience is warm/hot, value is clear, objections handled

### 2. TRANSITIONAL CTAs (Low Commitment)
Smaller step toward eventual conversion.
- "Learn More"
- "See How It Works"
- "Watch Demo"
- "Get Free Guide"

**Use when**: Cold audience, early in funnel, high-ticket product

### 3. PROGRESSIVE CTAs (Multi-Step)
Sequence of increasing commitment.
- Step 1: "Watch Video" → Step 2: "Try Free" → Step 3: "Upgrade"
- Step 1: "Read Guide" → Step 2: "Get Templates" → Step 3: "Book Call"

**Use when**: Complex products, long sales cycles, education needed

### The CTA Formula

```
## Anatomy of a High-Converting CTA

### The Core Formula
[Action Verb] + [Value/Benefit] + [Time/Ease Modifier]

### Examples
- "Get Your Free Report" (action + value)
- "Start Saving Today" (action + benefit + time)
- "Claim Your Spot Now" (action + scarcity + urgency)
- "See Plans & Pricing" (action + clarity)
- "Join 10,000+ Marketers" (action + social proof)

### What Makes CTAs Work

**1. First-Person Voice**
"Start MY Free Trial" outperforms "Start YOUR Free Trial"
"Get MY Quote" outperforms "Get A Quote"

**2. Value Over Action**
"Get Instant Access" beats "Submit"
"Start Saving" beats "Sign Up"
"See Your Results" beats "Calculate"

**3. Specificity**
"Download the 47-Page Guide" beats "Download Guide"
"Book Your 15-Minute Call" beats "Book a Call"
"Get 30% Off Today" beats "Get Discount"

**4. Reduced Anxiety**
"Start Free—No Credit Card" beats "Start Free Trial"
"See Pricing (No Signup Required)" beats "See Pricing"
```

Avoid:
- "Buy Now" (too aggressive)

### WARM TRAFFIC (Solution-Aware)
Medium commitment, solution focus

Good:
- "See Plans & Pricing"
- "Compare Options"
- "Watch Demo"
- "Explore Features"
- "Get a Quote"

### HOT TRAFFIC (Product/Most-Aware)
High commitment, conversion focus

Good:
- "Start Free Trial"

### Common CTA Mistakes

```
## CTAs to Avoid

### Vague CTAs
❌ "Submit"
❌ "Click Here"
❌ "Go"
❌ "Continue"
❌ "Next"

### Why They Fail:
- No value communicated
- No reason to click
- Could mean anything

### Scary CTAs (for cold audiences)
❌ "Buy Now" (on a cold landing page)
❌ "Schedule Call" (before they know you)
❌ "Start Trial" (before they understand product)

### Confusing CTAs
❌ Multiple CTAs with same visual weight
❌ CTA that doesn't match page goal
❌ CTA that contradicts headline promise
```

## Examples

### Example 1: SaaS Landing Page CTAs

**Context**: Project management software, cold traffic landing page

**Input**:
> Write CTAs for a project management SaaS. Page goal is free trial signup. Traffic is cold.

**Output**:

**Primary CTA Stack:**

**Headline**: "Finally See Everything in One Place"

**CTA Button**: "Start My Free Trial"

**Microcopy Below**: "No credit card required • Setup in 2 minutes"

---

**Alternative CTAs for A/B Testing:**

| Version | Button Text | Microcopy |
|---------|-------------|-----------|
| A | "Start My Free Trial" | "No credit card required" |
| B | "Try Free for 14 Days" | "Cancel anytime" |
| C | "See ProjectX in Action" | "No signup needed to explore" |
| D | "Create My First Project" | "Free forever plan available" |

---

**Transitional CTA (for hesitant visitors):**

Below the primary CTA:
"Not ready yet? → Watch how Sarah from Stripe uses ProjectX (2 min)"

---

### Example 2: E-commerce Product Page

**Context**: Premium skincare product, $85 price point

**Input**:
> Write CTAs for a high-end skincare product. Main objection: price.

**Output**:

**Primary CTA:**
Button: "Add to Cart—Free Shipping"
Below: "60-day money-back guarantee • Over 12,000 5-star reviews"

**Alternative Stack (addressing price objection):**
```
[Add to Cart—Free Shipping]

✓ Lasts 3 months (just $0.94/day)
✓ 60-day money-back guarantee
✓ Free returns, no questions
```

**For Comparison Shoppers:**
Secondary link below: "Compare to [competitor] →"

---

### Example 3: B2B Lead Gen

**Context**: Enterprise software, long sales cycle, need to book demos

**Input**:
> Write CTAs for enterprise sales software. Goal is demo booking. Audience is decision-makers researching options.

**Output**:

**Progressive CTA Strategy:**

**Top of Page (Cold):**
"See How It Works" → plays product video

**Middle of Page (Warming):**
"Get the ROI Calculator" → lead magnet

**Bottom of Page (Warm):**
"Schedule Your 20-Minute Demo"
Microcopy: "Talk to a specialist (not a salesperson) • No pressure, no BS"

**Footer Sticky CTA:**
"Questions? Let's Chat" → opens chatbot

---

**Demo Booking CTA with Anxiety Reduction:**
```
[Book My Free Demo]

Choose your time → No prep required → 20 minutes max

✓ Get a custom pricing quote
✓ See your use case specifically
✓ Meet your potential customer success manager

"This is NOT a sales call. It's a working session to see if we're a fit."
```

**Core Principle:** Find the "tallest skyscraper" in your space—content that already attracts many backlinks—and build something even better. Then reach out to people who linked to the original, offering them a superior resource.

> "It's human nature to be attracted to the best. And what you're doing here is finding the 'tallest skyscraper' in your space… and slapping 20 stories to the top of it."

## Instructions

### The Three-Step Framework

#### Overview

| Step | Action | Outcome |
|------|--------|---------|
| **Step 1** | Find Link-Worthy Content | Proven topic with backlink demand |
| **Step 2** | Make Something 10x Better | Clearly superior content |
| **Step 3** | Reach Out to the Right People | Targeted, qualified prospects |

---

### Step 1: Find Proven Linkable Assets

A linkable asset is a high-value page you can leverage for links repeatedly. The key is finding content that has ALREADY earned significant backlinks.

#### What Makes Good Linkable Assets

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Ultimate Guides** | Comprehensive topic coverage | "Complete Guide to [Topic]" |
| **Original Research** | Data-driven studies | "2024 State of [Industry]" |
| **Resource Lists** | Curated collections | "100 Best Tools for [Task]" |
| **How-to Content** | Step-by-step tutorials | "How to [Achieve Result]" |
| **Statistics Roundups** | Compiled data points | "[Topic] Statistics 2024" |

#### How to Find Linkable Assets

**Method 1: Backlink Analysis Tools**

Use Ahrefs, Semrush, or Moz to find competitor's most-linked pages:
1. Enter competitor domain
2. Go to "Best by Links" or "Top Pages" report
3. Sort by referring domains
4. Identify content topics with 50-100+ linking domains

**Method 2: Search + Analyze**

1. Search your target keyword
2. Analyze top-ranking pages in backlink tool
3. Compare backlink profiles
4. Identify most-linked content on the topic

**Method 3: Content Explorer**

Use Ahrefs Content Explorer or BuzzSumo:
1. Search your topic
2. Filter by "Referring domains" (high to low)
3. Find content with substantial backlinks
4. Analyze what made it link-worthy

#### Selection Criteria

| Criterion | Minimum | Ideal |
|-----------|---------|-------|
| **Referring Domains** | 50+ | 100+ |
| **Domain Quality** | Mix of sites | Authority sites in niche |
| **Topic Relevance** | Related to your niche | Core to your expertise |
| **Improvement Potential** | Some gaps | Clear weaknesses |
| **Content Age** | Under 5 years | 2-3 years (outdated) |

---

### Step 2: Make Something 10x Better

The original technique emphasized being "better"—but that bar has risen dramatically. You now need to be **substantially, objectively superior**.

#### The 10x Better Framework

| Dimension | How to Improve | Example |
|-----------|----------------|---------|
| **More Comprehensive** | Cover more sub-topics | 50 items → 200 items |
| **More Current** | Update outdated info | 2021 stats → 2024 stats |
| **Better Designed** | Superior visual presentation | Plain text → Custom graphics |
| **More Thorough** | Add depth to each point | Bullet points → Detailed explanations |
| **More Original** | Add unique research/insights | Compiled info → Original data |

#### Creating 10x Content

**1. Comprehensive Improvement**

If the original has "50 Tips," create "200+ Tips" but ONLY if you can maintain quality. Length without value is counterproductive.

**2. Freshness Improvement**

Find content with outdated:
- Statistics and data
- Tool recommendations
- Best practices
- Examples and case studies
- Industry trends

Update everything with current information.

**3. Design Improvement**

Add:
- Custom illustrations and diagrams
- Professional header graphics
- Better typography and formatting
- Interactive elements
- Downloadable resources

**4. Depth Improvement**

Transform:
- Bullet lists → Detailed explanations
- Generic advice → Specific tactics
- Assertions → Evidence-backed claims
- Theory → Step-by-step tutorials

**5. Originality Improvement**

Include:
- Original research and surveys
- Expert quotes and interviews
- Case studies with real data
- Unique frameworks and models
- First-hand experience

#### The Critical Test

Ask yourself: **"If I were the site owner, would I update my link to point to this instead?"**

If the answer isn't an obvious "yes," your content isn't different enough.

---

### Step 3: Reach Out to the Right People

This is where most people fail. The power of the Skyscraper Technique is reaching **pre-qualified prospects**—people who have already linked to similar content.

#### Building Your Prospect List

**1. Export Backlinks**

Use your SEO tool to export all referring domains to the original content.

**2. Clean the List**

Remove:
- Forums and Q&A sites (usually nofollow)
- Article directories
- Bookmarking sites
- Irrelevant/unrelated sites
- Low-quality domains
- Sites that no longer exist

Keep:
- Blogs in your niche
- Industry publications
- Resource pages
- Roundup posts
- Educational sites

**3. Find Contact Information**

For each qualified site:
- Find the article author
- Locate their email (Hunter.io, FindThatLead)
- Note the specific page they linked from
- Understand context of the original link

#### Crafting Effective Outreach

**The Foundation Email Structure:**

```
1. Personalized opener (show you read their content)
2. Reference to the link they already have
3. Introduction of your improved content
4. Clear value proposition (why yours is better)
5. Easy next step (specific suggestion)
6. Non-pushy close
```

**Modern Outreach Template:**

```
Subject: Quick note about your [Topic] article

Hey [Name],

I was reading your article on [specific article topic] and really enjoyed [specific point they made—be genuine].

I noticed you linked to [Original Article Name] as a resource for [context of the link].

I just published a significantly updated take on that topic: [Your URL]

What makes it different:
• [Specific improvement #1]
• [Specific improvement #2]
• [Specific improvement #3]

Might be a helpful update for your readers since [reason—e.g., the original is now 3 years old].

Either way, loved your piece on [topic].

[Your Name]
```

**Outreach Do's and Don'ts:**

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Personalize every email | Use obvious templates |
| Be specific about improvements | Say "I wrote something better" |
| Reference their actual content | Be generic |
| Make linking easy | Create friction |
| Accept "no" gracefully | Follow up aggressively |
| Provide value first | Ask for favors |

#### Tracking Results

| Metric | Target | Excellent |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| **Open Rate** | 30%+ | 50%+ |
| **Reply Rate** | 10%+ | 20%+ |
| **Link Rate** | 5%+ | 10%+ |

---

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

| Pitfall | Why It Fails | Solution |
|---------|--------------|----------|
| **Marginal improvement** | Not compelling enough to switch links | Aim for 10x better |
| **Template outreach** | Everyone uses the same templates | Write genuinely personal emails |
| **Wrong prospects** | Targeting irrelevant sites | Clean list thoroughly |
| **No follow-up** | People miss emails | One polite follow-up after 7 days |
| **Giving up early** | Link building takes time | Commit to 100+ outreach emails |
| **Ignoring quality** | Chasing quantity over quality | Focus on getting 10 great links vs. 50 weak ones |

---

**Analysis:**

**Sample Outreach Email:**

```
Subject: Updated resource for your email marketing guide

Hi Sarah,

Your article "Complete Guide to Email Marketing for Startups" is one of my go-to resources for clients just getting started—the section on list building is especially practical.

I noticed you link to [Competitor]'s email statistics page from 2022.

Analyze "free budget template" content:
- NerdWallet template page: 180 referring domains
- Mint's budgeting guide: 220 referring domains

Target two groups:

- Pitch: "Excellent addition to your resources section"

**Sample Email for Resource Page:**

```
Subject: Resource for your budgeting tools page

Hi Mike,

I stumbled across your "Best Free Financial Tools" page while researching budgeting apps—great collection, especially the debt payoff calculator recommendation.

I noticed you don't have a dedicated budget template resource listed.

We just released a free template library with 25 budget templates:
[URL]

Covers different life situations (students, families, freelancers, retirees) and formats (Excel, Google Sheets, Notion, PDF).

Might be a good fit alongside your other tools?

Cheers,

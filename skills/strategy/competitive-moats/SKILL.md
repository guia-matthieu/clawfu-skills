- **Evaluate your competitive position** and identify if you have true Power
- **Choose strategic direction** for building durable advantage
- **Analyze competitors** to understand their moats and vulnerabilities
- **Advise on M&A** whether an acquisition target has defensible value
- **Assess startup investment** potential for sustainable returns
- **Plan market entry** and determine if you can build Power against incumbents
- **Diagnose strategic weakness** when growth isn't translating to profits
- **Prioritize initiatives** by their potential to create or strengthen moats

This skill is particularly valuable for:
- Founders and executives making strategic decisions
- Investors evaluating businesses for defensibility
- Product managers prioritizing features that build advantage
- Strategy consultants analyzing competitive dynamics
- Anyone who suspects their business is vulnerable to commoditization

---

## Methodology Foundation

**Source:** Hamilton Helmer - *7 Powers: The Foundations of Business Strategy* (2016)

**Core Principle:** Power is the set of conditions that enables a business to achieve persistent differential returns. Power requires both a Benefit (something that improves cash flow) AND a Barrier (something that prevents competitors from arbitraging away that benefit).

> "A business without Power is a business without a moat, and a business without a moat eventually becomes a commodity."

## What Claude Does vs What You Decide

| Claude Does | You Decide |
|-------------|------------|
| Structures content frameworks | Final messaging |
| Suggests persuasion techniques | Brand voice |
| Creates draft variations | Version selection |
| Identifies optimization opportunities | Publication timing |
| Analyzes competitor approaches | Strategic direction |

## What This Skill Does

When invoked, I will guide you through the 7 Powers framework:

1. **Diagnose current Power** by evaluating your business against all 7 types
2. **Identify Power potential** based on your market position and lifecycle stage
3. **Analyze competitor moats** to find vulnerabilities and threats
4. **Develop Power-building strategy** with specific initiatives
5. **Evaluate acquisitions or investments** for sustainable advantage
6. **Prioritize strategic decisions** by their impact on Power

---

## How to Use

Provide information about your strategic situation:

**Example prompts:**

- "Analyze my SaaS business for competitive moats—what Power do we have?"
- "How can we build Network Effects in our marketplace?"
- "Is our competitor vulnerable to Counter-Positioning?"
- "What moat strategy should a Series A startup pursue?"
- "Evaluate whether this acquisition target has durable Power"

**Information that helps:**

- Your business model and value proposition
- Key competitors and their positions
- Customer segments and behavior
- Cost structure and margins
- Company lifecycle stage (startup, growth, mature)
- Current strategic initiatives

---

## Instructions

### Phase 1: Understand the Power Equation

**Power = Benefit + Barrier**

Both elements are required:
- **Benefit**: A condition that materially increases cash flow (lower costs, higher prices, better retention)
- **Barrier**: A condition that prevents competitors from offering the same benefit

| Situation | Power? |
|-----------|--------|
| Lower costs, competitors can easily match | No |
| Premium pricing, brand built over decades | Yes |
| First to market, no structural advantage | No |
| Network effects with critical mass reached | Yes |

**The Strategy Equation:**

Value = Market Size × Power

Both matter. Power in a tiny market yields limited returns. A huge market without Power leads to commoditization.

---

### Phase 2: Evaluate the 7 Powers

Systematically assess your business against each Power type:

#### 1. Scale Economies

**Definition:** Per-unit costs decline as production volume increases.

**Benefit:** Lower costs than smaller competitors.

**Barrier:** Competitors need massive investment with uncertain returns to match your scale.

**Identification Questions:**
- Do your fixed costs represent a large share of total costs?
- Does volume significantly reduce per-unit economics?
- Are you the scale leader in your market?

**Examples:**
| Company | Scale Advantage |
|---------|-----------------|
| Netflix | Content costs spread across 200M+ subscribers |
| Walmart | Distribution network amortized across thousands of stores |
| Intel | Fab investment spread over enormous chip volumes |

**Build Strategy:** Race to scale before competitors. "The first to scale wins." Requires aggressive investment and acceptance of near-term losses.

---

#### 2. Network Effects

**Definition:** Product value increases as more users adopt it.

**Benefit:** Higher value to each user, better retention, higher willingness to pay.

**Barrier:** Competitors face chicken-and-egg problem—can't provide value without network size.

**Types:**
| Type | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| Direct | More users = more value | WhatsApp, Facebook |
| Indirect | More users attract complements | iOS apps, Uber drivers |
| Data | More users = better product | Google Search, Waze |

**Identification Questions:**
- Does each additional user make the product more valuable?
- Would users face value loss if others left?
- Is there a tipping point beyond which growth accelerates?

**Examples:**
| Company | Network Effect |
|---------|---------------|
| LinkedIn | Professional network value grows with members |
| Airbnb | More hosts = more traveler options = more hosts |
| Visa | More merchants = more cardholders = more merchants |

**Build Strategy:** Achieve critical mass in a focused segment before expanding. Often requires subsidizing one side of the network.

---

#### 3. Counter-Positioning

**Definition:** A newcomer adopts a superior model that incumbents can't copy without damaging their existing business.

**Benefit:** Better business model (higher margins, better value, etc.).

**Barrier:** Incumbents face "damned if you do, damned if you don't" dilemma.

**Identification Questions:**
- Would copying your model hurt incumbents more than ignoring you?
- Are incumbents rationally choosing NOT to respond?
- Is your advantage structural, not just executional?

**Examples:**
| Disruptor | Incumbent | Why They Can't Copy |
|-----------|-----------|-------------------|
| Vanguard index funds | Active managers | Would destroy fee income |
| Netflix streaming | Blockbuster | Would kill stores/late fees |
| Tesla direct sales | Traditional dealers | Would alienate dealer network |

**Build Strategy:** Find business model innovations that create customer value AND are economically painful for incumbents to match.

---

#### 4. Switching Costs

**Definition:** Value loss expected by customers when switching to alternatives.

**Benefit:** Customer retention, higher lifetime value, pricing power.

**Barrier:** Competitors must compensate for switching costs, not just match value.

**Types:**
| Type | Examples |
|------|----------|
| Financial | Contracts, hardware, training investment |
| Procedural | Learning curve, data migration, workflow disruption |
| Relational | Customization loss, relationship continuity |

**Identification Questions:**
- How much would customers lose by switching?
- Do switching costs grow over time with usage?
- Are customers locked in by multiple types of costs?

**Examples:**
| Company | Switching Cost |
|---------|---------------|
| SAP/Oracle | Deep integration, migration costs millions |
| Apple ecosystem | Apps, iCloud, iMessage, Watch compatibility |
| Banks | Direct deposits, auto-payments, linked accounts |

**Build Strategy:** Create integration hooks, encourage deep usage, build proprietary data/customization.

---

#### 5. Branding

**Definition:** Durable attribution of higher value to an objectively identical offering based on seller reputation.

**Benefit:** Price premium or preference over equivalent alternatives.

**Barrier:** Brand building requires time and consistent delivery—cannot be bought or replicated quickly.

**Two Types:**
| Type | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| Affective Valence | Emotional connection, identity | Luxury goods, lifestyle brands |
| Uncertainty Reduction | Trust in quality | Professional services, B2B |

**Identification Questions:**
- Would customers pay more for your brand vs. identical alternative?
- Is the brand preference based on more than product attributes?
- Has the brand been built over significant time?

**Examples:**
| Company | Brand Power |
|---------|-------------|
| Tiffany's | Identical diamond commands premium |
| Coca-Cola | Similar to store brand, massive preference |
| McKinsey | "No one gets fired for hiring McKinsey" |

**Build Strategy:** Long-term consistent delivery on brand promise. Cannot be shortcut. Requires patience.

---

#### 6. Cornered Resource

**Definition:** Preferential access to a coveted asset that independently enhances value.

**Benefit:** Access to something competitors can't match.

**Barrier:** The resource is exclusive or extremely difficult to obtain.

**Types:**
| Type | Examples |
|------|----------|
| Talent | Key scientists, creatives, executives |
| IP | Patents, proprietary tech, unique data |
| Geographic | Prime locations, regulatory licenses |
| Relationships | Exclusive partnerships, supplier agreements |

**Identification Questions:**
- Do you have access to something valuable that others don't?
- Is the resource both valuable AND exclusive?
- Could competitors acquire equivalent access?

**Examples:**
| Company | Cornered Resource |
|---------|------------------|
| Pixar | Creative "Brain Trust" talent |
| Pharma patents | 20-year exclusive drug rights |
| Sports teams | Star players, local broadcast rights |

**Build Strategy:** Identify resources critical to your industry and secure preferential access before competitors recognize their value.

---

#### 7. Process Power

**Definition:** Embedded organization and activities that enable superior performance, matchable only through extended commitment.

**Benefit:** Operational excellence that can't be replicated by decision.

**Barrier:** Processes are embedded in culture, tacit knowledge, organizational routines. Copying requires years with uncertain success.

**Identification Questions:**
- Do competitors admire and try to copy your operations?
- Has the capability been built over many years?
- Could a competitor with unlimited budget replicate it quickly?

**Examples:**
| Company | Process Power |
|---------|--------------|
| Toyota | Production system took decades to develop and copy |
| IKEA | Integrated design-manufacturing-retail system |
| Amazon | Fulfillment combining tech, logistics, culture |

**Build Strategy:** Long-term investment in organizational capability. Often emerges from founder obsession or cultural DNA.

---

### Phase 3: Map Power to Lifecycle Stage

Different Powers are accessible at different company stages:

| Stage | Available Powers | Characteristics |
|-------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Takeoff** | Counter-Positioning, Cornered Resource, Scale Economies | New entrant, model innovation |
| **Growth** | Network Effects, Switching Costs, Scale Economies | Building position, locking in advantage |
| **Maturity** | Branding, Process Power | Long time horizons, organizational investment |

**Strategic Implications:**
- Startups should focus on Counter-Positioning, Cornered Resource, or racing to Scale
- Growth companies should invest in Network Effects and Switching Costs
- Mature companies can build Branding and Process Power

---

### Phase 4: Analyze Competitor Moats

For each significant competitor:

1. **Identify their Power type** (if any)
2. **Assess the Barrier strength** (how durable?)
3. **Find vulnerabilities** (where is their moat weakest?)
4. **Evaluate evolution** (is their Power strengthening or eroding?)

**Competitor Analysis Matrix:**

| Competitor | Power Type | Barrier Strength | Vulnerability |
|------------|-----------|------------------|---------------|
| [Name] | [Type] | Strong/Medium/Weak | [Gap] |

---

### Phase 5: Develop Power-Building Strategy

Based on your analysis, prioritize initiatives that build or strengthen Power:

**Initiative Prioritization:**

| Initiative | Power Type Affected | Impact on Barrier | Feasibility | Priority |
|------------|--------------------|--------------------|------------|----------|
| [Action] | [Type] | High/Medium/Low | High/Medium/Low | [1-5] |

**Key Questions:**
1. Which Power type is most achievable given your position?
2. What specific actions would build that Power?
3. What investment (time, capital) is required?
4. What milestones indicate Power is being established?

---

## Examples

### Example 1: B2B SaaS Company (Marketing Automation)

**Company Profile:**
- 5,000 customers, $30M ARR
- Growth: 40% YoY
- Market: Mid-market companies ($10M-$500M revenue)
- Competition: Several well-funded competitors

**Power Analysis:**

| Power Type | Assessment | Rating |
|------------|-----------|--------|
| Scale Economies | Limited—SaaS costs don't decline dramatically with scale | Weak |
| Network Effects | None—each customer uses independently | None |
| Counter-Positioning | No—similar model to competitors | None |
| Switching Costs | Moderate—data/integration dependencies | Medium |
| Branding | Growing reputation in category | Weak |
| Cornered Resource | None—no unique assets | None |
| Process Power | None—standard SaaS operations | None |

**Diagnosis:** Limited Power. Primary advantage is Switching Costs, but they're moderate.

**Recommendations:**

1. **Strengthen Switching Costs** (Primary Strategy)
   - Deeper integrations with customer tech stack
   - Proprietary data that accumulates over time
   - Custom workflows that would be costly to recreate
   - Build "Expansion Revenue" features that increase lock-in

2. **Explore Network Effects** (Secondary Strategy)
   - Customer community with shared benchmarks
   - Marketplace for templates/integrations
   - Data network effects (aggregate insights)

3. **Long-term Brand Building**
   - Thought leadership positioning
   - Customer success stories
   - Category association

**Priority Actions:**
1. Double down on integration depth (Switching Costs)
2. Launch customer community (potential Network Effects)
3. Build proprietary benchmark data (Cornered Resource attempt)

---

### Example 2: DTC Consumer Brand (Premium Coffee)

**Company Profile:**
- 3 years old, $15M revenue
- Direct-to-consumer subscription model
- Premium positioning ($25/bag vs. $12 grocery average)
- Competition: Blue Bottle, Stumptown, local roasters, grocery brands

**Power Analysis:**

| Power Type | Assessment | Rating |
|------------|-----------|--------|
| Scale Economies | None—roasting doesn't favor scale, sourcing competitive | None |
| Network Effects | None—coffee consumption is individual | None |
| Counter-Positioning | Partial—DTC vs. grocery, but competitors use same model | Weak |
| Switching Costs | Low—easy to try other brands | Weak |
| Branding | Building—premium identity, design-forward | Medium |
| Cornered Resource | None—beans available to all | None |
| Process Power | None—standard roasting operations | None |

**Diagnosis:** Primary Power potential is Branding, but it's early and weak. Vulnerable position.

**Recommendations:**

1. **Double Down on Brand** (Primary Strategy)
   - Brand isn't just awareness—must create genuine price premium
   - Focus on affective valence (identity, lifestyle association)
   - Long time horizon—no shortcuts

2. **Explore Cornered Resource** (Secondary Strategy)
   - Exclusive farmer relationships
   - Proprietary processing methods
   - Unique varietals

3. **Build Switching Costs** (Tertiary Strategy)
   - Subscription friction (not just convenience)
   - Personalization based on taste profile
   - Rewards/loyalty programs

**Honest Assessment:** Coffee is a challenging category for Power. Most coffee brands compete on quality and marketing without true moats. Strategy should focus on:
1. Building genuine brand love (not just awareness)
2. Exploring exclusive sourcing relationships
3. Considering whether the category supports premium economics long-term

# Six Thinking Hats

> Apply Edward de Bono's parallel thinking framework (1985) to make better decisions by examining ideas from six distinct perspectives systematically.

## When to Use This Skill

- **Making complex decisions** that require multiple perspectives
- **Evaluating new products, offers, or strategies** before launch
- **Breaking out of analysis paralysis** with structured thinking
- **Running productive meetings** where everyone thinks in the same direction
- **Balancing optimism with caution** in strategic planning
- **Generating creative alternatives** when stuck on a problem

## Methodology Foundation

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Source** | Six Thinking Hats (1985) |
| **Expert** | Edward de Bono - Coined "lateral thinking", advisor to IBM, Shell, NASA |
| **Core Principle** | "Parallel thinking" - Instead of adversarial debate, everyone thinks in the same direction at the same time, switching perspectives together |


## What Claude Does vs What You Decide

| Claude Does | You Decide |
|-------------|------------|
| Structures content frameworks | Final messaging |
| Suggests persuasion techniques | Brand voice |
| Creates draft variations | Version selection |
| Identifies optimization opportunities | Publication timing |
| Analyzes competitor approaches | Strategic direction |

## What This Skill Does

This skill replaces chaotic brainstorming and unproductive debates with **structured parallel thinking**.

Instead of people defending positions and attacking others, everyone:
1. Examines **facts** together (White)
2. Shares **feelings** together (Red)
3. Explores **risks** together (Black)
4. Discovers **benefits** together (Yellow)
5. Generates **alternatives** together (Green)
6. Manages the **process** together (Blue)

The result: Faster decisions, better buy-in, more creative solutions, and reduced conflict.

## How to Use

### Analyze a Decision or Strategy
```
Apply the Six Thinking Hats to analyze:
[describe decision, product, strategy, or problem]

Go through each hat systematically and provide insights.
```

### Run a Structured Evaluation
```
I need to decide whether to [decision].
Walk me through Six Thinking Hats analysis with specific questions for each hat.
```

### Generate Creative Alternatives
```
Use Six Thinking Hats (focusing on Green Hat) to generate alternatives for:
[current approach or problem]
First establish context with White and Red, then expand with Green.
```

### Hat 1: BLUE HAT (Process Control)

```
## 🎩 BLUE HAT - The Conductor

**Focus:** Managing the thinking process itself

**Role:** The Blue Hat is the "meta" hat - it controls which hat is used
when, keeps the group focused, and summarizes conclusions.

**When to Use:**
- At the START: Define the problem and set the agenda
- DURING: Switch hats, refocus discussion
- At the END: Summarize findings and next steps

**Blue Hat Questions:**
- What is the problem we're trying to solve?
- What outcome do we want from this thinking session?
- Which hat should we use next?
- Have we spent enough time on this perspective?
- What have we concluded so far?
- What are the next steps?

**Blue Hat Outputs:**
- Clear problem definition
- Thinking agenda (hat sequence)
- Time allocation per hat
- Summary of insights
- Action items and decisions

**Tip:** Start and end every session with Blue Hat.
```

---

### Hat 2: WHITE HAT (Facts & Information)

```
## ⬜ WHITE HAT - The Scientist

**Focus:** Objective facts, data, and information

**Role:** Neutral, factual thinking. No interpretations, no opinions.
Just "what do we know?" and "what do we need to find out?"

**When to Use:**
- Early in the process to establish baseline
- When debate gets heated (return to facts)
- Before making final decisions

**White Hat Questions:**
- What data do we have?
- What are the facts?
- What information is missing?
- How reliable is this information?
- What do the numbers say?
- What has happened in similar situations?

**White Hat Outputs:**
- List of known facts
- Data points and metrics
- Gaps in information
- Sources and reliability assessment
- Historical precedents

**Rules:**
- NO opinions ("I think..." = Red Hat)
- NO judgments ("That's bad..." = Black Hat)
- Just facts: "Sales were 10,000 units" ✓
- Flag uncertainty: "We believe X, but haven't verified"

**Example:**
❌ "The market is too competitive" (opinion)
✅ "There are 47 competitors. Top 3 have 60% market share." (fact)
```

---

### Hat 3: RED HAT (Emotions & Intuition)

```
## ❤️ RED HAT - The Heart

**Focus:** Feelings, intuition, gut reactions

**Role:** Express emotions WITHOUT justification. No need to explain
why you feel something - just state the feeling.

**When to Use:**
- After establishing facts (gauge emotional response)
- When something "feels off" but can't be articulated
- To surface hidden concerns or excitement
- Before final decisions (gut check)

**Red Hat Questions:**
- How do you feel about this?
- What's your gut reaction?
- What excites you about this?
- What worries you (emotionally)?
- If you had to decide right now, what would you choose?
- What's your intuition saying?

**Red Hat Outputs:**
- Emotional reactions (positive and negative)
- Intuitive hunches
- Excitement levels
- Concern levels
- Gut-based preferences

**Rules:**
- NO justification required
- "I don't like it" is valid (no need for why)
- Feelings are data points, not arguments
- Everyone's feelings are legitimate
- Brief expressions (not long explanations)

**Example:**
✅ "I feel excited about this"
✅ "Something feels off, I'm not sure what"
✅ "My gut says we should wait"
❌ "I feel this won't work because the market is saturated" (that's Black Hat)
```

---

### Hat 4: BLACK HAT (Caution & Risks)

```
## ⚫ BLACK HAT - The Judge

**Focus:** Caution, risks, problems, what could go wrong

**Role:** Critical thinking - identify weaknesses, dangers, and flaws.
This is NOT negativity for its own sake, but protective thinking.

**When to Use:**
- After Yellow Hat (balance optimism with caution)
- Before committing resources
- To stress-test ideas
- To identify what needs mitigation

**Black Hat Questions:**
- What could go wrong?
- What are the risks?
- What are the weaknesses?
- Why might this fail?
- What obstacles will we face?
- What are the costs and downsides?
- Does this fit with our resources/capabilities?
- What have we overlooked?

**Black Hat Outputs:**
- List of risks and dangers
- Potential failure modes
- Resource constraints
- Logical flaws in the plan
- External threats
- Implementation challenges

**Rules:**
- Must be LOGICAL (not just feelings - that's Red)
- Point to specific risks, not vague negativity
- "This could fail because X" ✓
- "I just don't like it" ✗ (that's Red Hat)

**The Black Hat is VALUABLE:**
- Prevents disasters
- Identifies what needs fixing
- Ensures realistic planning
- Required before any major decision

**Example:**
✅ "If competitors copy this in 3 months, we lose first-mover advantage"
✅ "Our team has never done X before - execution risk is high"
❌ "This will never work" (too vague)
```

---

### Hat 5: YELLOW HAT (Benefits & Value)

```
## 💛 YELLOW HAT - The Optimist

**Focus:** Benefits, value, why it will work

**Role:** Constructive, positive thinking. Find the value and benefits.
Look for what's good about an idea.

**When to Use:**
- To explore the upside of ideas
- When team is too negative
- To build enthusiasm and motivation
- To find value in unexpected places

**Yellow Hat Questions:**
- What are the benefits?
- Why will this work?
- What's the best-case scenario?
- Who gains from this and how?
- What opportunities does this create?
- What's valuable about this idea?
- How can we make this succeed?

**Yellow Hat Outputs:**
- List of benefits
- Value propositions
- Success scenarios
- Opportunity identification
- Reasons for optimism
- Supporting evidence for success

**Rules:**
- Must have LOGICAL basis (not just hope)
- "This will work because X" ✓
- "I hope it works" ✗ (that's Red Hat)
- Find genuine benefits, not forced positivity

**Balance with Black Hat:**
Yellow without Black = naive optimism
Black without Yellow = paralysis
Both together = realistic assessment

**Example:**
✅ "If we capture 5% of the market, that's $2M revenue"
✅ "This positions us as thought leaders in an emerging space"
❌ "It'll be great!" (no substance)
```

### Hat 6: GREEN HAT (Creativity & Alternatives)

```
## 💚 GREEN HAT - The Creator

**Focus:** New ideas, alternatives, creative solutions

**Role:** Generate possibilities without judgment. Explore "what if?"
Think beyond obvious solutions.

**When to Use:**
- When stuck on a problem
- After Black Hat identifies problems (find solutions)
- To generate options before deciding
- When current approach isn't working

**Green Hat Questions:**
- What alternatives exist?
- What if we did the opposite?
- How might we approach this differently?
- What would [successful company/person] do?
- What's a completely new way to solve this?
- How can we overcome the Black Hat concerns?
- What assumptions can we challenge?

**Green Hat Techniques:**
- **Random Entry:** Pick random word, connect to problem
- **Reversal:** What's the opposite approach?
- **Analogy:** How do other industries solve this?
- **Exaggeration:** What if we 10x'd this element?
- **Combination:** Merge two different approaches

**Green Hat Outputs:**
- List of alternative approaches
- Creative solutions
- New ideas to explore
- Modifications to existing ideas
- "What if" scenarios

**Rules:**
- NO judgment during Green Hat (judgment = Black)
- Quantity over quality initially
- Build on others' ideas ("Yes, and...")
- Suspend disbelief temporarily
- Wild ideas welcome (can be refined later)

**Example:**
✅ "What if we gave it away free and monetized differently?"
✅ "What if we partnered with competitors instead of fighting them?"
✅ "What if we targeted the opposite customer segment?"
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Evaluating a New Product Launch

**Context:** SaaS company considering launching a mobile app

**🎩 Blue Hat (Setup):**
> We're evaluating whether to launch a mobile app for our project management tool. We want to decide: build, don't build, or build later. Let's spend 5 minutes per hat.

**⬜ White Hat (Facts):**
> - 34% of our users access via mobile browser
> - Competitors X and Y have apps (4.2 and 3.8 star ratings)
> - Development estimate: 4-6 months, $120K
> - Our NPS is 47 (desktop users)
> - Mobile browser bounce rate: 67% (vs 23% desktop)
> - We have 2 mobile developers available

**❤️ Red Hat (Feelings):**
> - "Excited - this could unlock new use cases"
> - "Nervous about the investment"
> - "Frustrated we haven't done this sooner"
> - "Gut says our users want this"

**💛 Yellow Hat (Benefits):**
> - Reduces friction for mobile users (67% bounce → potential wins)
> - Competitive parity with X and Y
> - Push notifications = higher engagement
> - New positioning as "work anywhere" tool
> - If 20% of mobile bouncers convert, that's 400 new users/month

**⚫ Black Hat (Risks):**
> - 6-month dev = opportunity cost (what else could we build?)
> - Mobile apps need ongoing maintenance (15-20% of dev time)
> - App store reviews are public - bad launch = reputation damage
> - Our mobile developers have never shipped an app
> - Desktop feature requests are piling up

**💚 Green Hat (Alternatives):**
> - Progressive Web App (PWA) instead of native?
> - Partner with app development agency?
> - Launch MVP with 3 core features only?
> - Build for one platform first (iOS or Android)?
> - Buy a smaller competitor with existing app?

**🎩 Blue Hat (Conclusion):**
> Decision: Build PWA first (lower risk, faster). If adoption exceeds 1,000 weekly users in 3 months, greenlight native app development.

---

### Example 2: Quick Decision on Pricing

**Context:** Should we raise prices by 20%?

**⬜ White (30 sec):** Current price $99. Competitors range $79-$149. Last increase was 18 months ago. Churn is 4.2% monthly.

**❤️ Red (30 sec):** "Nervous about customer backlash." "Feels overdue though."

**💛 Yellow (30 sec):** 20% more revenue on existing customers. Positions us as premium. Funds product improvements.

**⚫ Black (30 sec):** Some customers will leave. Acquisition might suffer. Timing during economic uncertainty.

**🎩 Blue (30 sec):** Decision: Raise prices 15% for new customers only. Grandfather existing for 6 months. Re-evaluate.

### Meeting Facilitation Guide

```markdown
## Running a Six Hats Meeting

### Preparation
- [ ] Define the topic/decision clearly
- [ ] Prepare White Hat data in advance
- [ ] Allocate time per hat (typically 5-10 min each)
- [ ] Brief participants on the method

### Rules to Establish
1. Everyone wears the same hat at the same time
2. No criticism during Green Hat
3. Red Hat feelings need no justification
4. Black Hat must be specific, not vague
5. Blue Hat facilitator controls hat switches

### Facilitation Tips
- Use physical props (colored cards/hats) if in person
- Announce hat switches clearly
- Redirect off-hat comments ("Let's save that for Black Hat")
- Keep time visible
- Capture outputs for each hat
- End with clear next steps

### Common Pitfalls
- Skipping Red Hat (emotions surface anyway, better explicit)
- Too much time on Black Hat (negativity spiral)
- Not enough time on Green Hat (settling for obvious)
- Mixing hats (debating during White Hat)
```

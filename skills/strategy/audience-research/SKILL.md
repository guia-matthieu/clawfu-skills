## Methodology Foundation

**Source:** Rand Fishkin - SparkToro / Audience Intelligence methodology

**Core Principle:** Traditional market research (surveys, interviews) cannot reliably tell you where to reach audiences you don't already reach. Behavioral data—what people actually visit, read, watch, listen to, and follow—fills this gap at scale.

> "Audience research has always been about what are the places where this audience pays attention. The beautiful thing about the web is it got way more granular."

---

## How to Use

Provide information about your target audience:

**Example prompts:**

- "Help me find where interior designers spend their time online"
- "I need to identify podcasts and YouTube channels for B2B SaaS marketers"
- "Research the online behaviors of sustainability-focused consumers"
- "Find hidden gem publications for pitching our fintech startup"
- "Discover influencers with real overlap to our developer audience"

**Information that helps:**

- Description of your target audience (role, industry, interests)
- Current assumptions about where they pay attention
- Competitors or comparable brands
- Marketing channels you've already tried
- Specific goals (PR outreach, content strategy, ad targeting, etc.)

---

## Instructions

### Phase 1: Define the Audience Query

**Critical shift:** Don't think in demographics—think in behaviors.

**Wrong approach:**
- "Marketing managers, 35-45, mid-size companies"

**Right approach:**
- "People who search for 'marketing automation tools'"
- "People who follow marketing thought leaders on LinkedIn"
- "People who listen to B2B marketing podcasts"

**Query Formats:**

| Query Type | Example | Best For |
|------------|---------|----------|
| **Job role** | "Content marketers" | B2B targeting |
| **Interest** | "Sustainable fashion" | Consumer markets |
| **Search behavior** | "People who search 'CRM software'" | Bottom-funnel intent |
| **Social following** | "Followers of @HubSpot" | Competitive intelligence |
| **Website visitors** | "People who visit techcrunch.com" | Media affinity |

---

### Phase 2: Gather Affinity Data

For your defined audience, identify:

#### Websites & Publications
What do they actually visit and read?
- Industry news sites
- Niche blogs
- Trade publications
- Community forums

### Phase 3: Analyze Search Behavior

- What conversations are emerging?
- What content is getting shared?

**Questions They Ask:**

---

### Phase 4: Extract Self-Description Patterns

**Bio Keywords:**

- Skills they highlight
- Industries they claim
- Causes they support

**Hashtags They Use:**
- Professional identifiers
- Community signals
- Interest markers
- Movement affiliations

**Language Patterns:**

---

### Phase 5: Apply the Rhetorical Lens

Analyze why certain channels resonate using Aristotle's framework:

#### Logos (Logic)
Does this channel appeal through:
- Structured, evidence-backed thinking?
- Step-by-step instructions?
- Data and benchmarks?
- Clear methodology?

**Implication:** Your content for this channel should be logical, structured, and evidence-based.

#### Pathos (Emotion)
Does this channel connect through:
- Acknowledging audience struggles?
- Relatable failures before solutions?
- Urgency and empathy?

**Implication:** Your outreach should acknowledge real challenges and emotional stakes.

#### Ethos (Credibility)
Does this channel build trust through:
- Author credentials?
- Transparency about process?
- Practitioner experience?

**Implication:** Lead with credibility signals and real experience.

---

### Phase 6: Competitive Landscape Mapping

**Direct Competitors:**
- Which of your competitors reach this audience?
- What channels are they present in?
- Where are they absent?

**Media Competitors:**
- Who produces content reaching your audience?
- What formats and topics resonate?
- Where are content gaps?

**Opportunity Identification:**
- Channels where competitors are NOT present
- Emerging channels with growing attention
- Underserved content topics

---

### Phase 7: Synthesize Actionable Insights

**Don't create generic personas.** Instead, create problem-specific insights:

| If Your Goal Is... | Your Output Should Be... |
|-------------------|-------------------------|
| PR outreach | Prioritized list of publications + pitch angles |
| Content strategy | Topics, formats, and distribution channels |
| Podcast advertising | Ranked shows by audience overlap + listener size |
| YouTube ads | Target channels + content themes |
| Influencer partnerships | Accounts with authentic audience overlap |
| Community building | Platforms where audience already gathers |

---

## Examples

### Example 1: B2B SaaS Company (Project Management Software)

**Audience Query:** "People who search for project management tools" + "People who follow productivity thought leaders"

**Affinity Data Discovered:**

| Category | Top Findings | Opportunity |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Podcasts** | The PM Podcast, Scrum Master Toolbox, Manager Tools | Sponsor or guest spots |
| **YouTube** | Ali Abdaal, Thomas Frank, Notion channels | Tutorial partnerships |
| **Publications** | PM Times, Atlassian Blog, Harvard Business Review | PR pitches, guest posts |
| **Subreddits** | r/projectmanagement, r/agile, r/productivity | Community engagement |
| **Social Accounts** | @johncutlefish, @labornotebook, @shreyas | Collaboration opportunities |

**Search Behavior:**
- "Asana vs Monday vs [competitor]"
- "How to manage remote team projects"
- "Agile project management for small teams"
- "Project management for non-project managers"

**Self-Description Patterns:**
- "PM", "Scrum Master", "Product Owner"
- #agile, #projectmanagement, #remotework
- "Helping teams deliver"

**Competitive Analysis:**
- Asana: Heavy presence in productivity YouTube
- Monday.com: Strong podcast advertising
- ClickUp: Reddit engagement
- **Opportunity:** PM Times and trade publications underserved

**Actionable Output:**

**For PR:** Pitch PM Times and Scrum publications with thought leadership on hybrid team management—competitors underrepresent this angle.

**For Content:** Create comparison content ("X vs Y for specific use case") targeting search behavior. Distribute via PM subreddits.

**For Ads:** Target PM-focused YouTube channels (Thomas Frank for SMB, Notion channels for tech-forward). Avoid oversaturated productivity generalists.

---

### Example 2: DTC Consumer Brand (Sustainable Home Goods)

**Audience Query:** "People interested in sustainable living" + "People who follow eco-conscious lifestyle accounts"

**Affinity Data Discovered:**

| Category | Top Findings | Opportunity |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| **Podcasts** | Conscious Chatter, Sustainably Influenced, The Minimalists | Sponsor placements |
| **YouTube** | Shelbizleee, Gittemary, Sustainably Vegan | Product reviews/gifts |
| **Publications** | Treehugger, The Good Trade, Ecocult | PR features |
| **Instagram** | @zerowastechef, @trashisfortossers, @sustainablychic | Influencer partnerships |
| **Subreddits** | r/zerowaste, r/buyitforlife, r/anticonsumption | Authentic engagement |

**Search Behavior:**
- "Sustainable alternatives to [product]"
- "Eco-friendly home goods"
- "How to reduce plastic in kitchen"
- "[Brand] reviews" for competitors

**Self-Description Patterns:**
- "Trying to live lighter", "Imperfect environmentalist"
- #sustainableliving, #consciousconsumer, #slowliving
- Values: Anti-greenwashing, authenticity, transparency

**Rhetorical Analysis:**

- **Logos:** r/buyitforlife is highly logic-driven (durability data, materials analysis). Content should be evidence-based.
- **Pathos:** Lifestyle influencers connect emotionally through "imperfect journey" framing. Avoid perfectionism.
- **Ethos:** Audience is skeptical of greenwashing. Transparency about supply chain = trust.

**Actionable Output:**

**For PR:** Lead with supply chain transparency story for The Good Trade. Avoid generic "eco-friendly" pitches—too many competitors.

**For Influencer:** Target mid-tier accounts (10-50K) who emphasize "imperfect sustainability." Avoid polished accounts—audience distrusts them.

**For Content:** Create "honest comparison" content for Reddit (r/zerowaste loves data-backed recommendations). Avoid promotional tone.

**For Ads:** Podcast sponsorship on Sustainably Influenced (aligned values) > generic lifestyle shows. Instagram ads targeting followers of mid-tier sustainable accounts.

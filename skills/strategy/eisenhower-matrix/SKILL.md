# Eisenhower Matrix

> "What is important is seldom urgent and what is urgent is seldom important." Master Dwight D. Eisenhower's prioritization framework to focus on what truly matters.

## When to Use This Skill

- **Feeling overwhelmed** by too many tasks and not enough time
- **Weekly planning** to set priorities for the week ahead
- **Daily triage** when everything seems urgent
- **Delegation decisions** to identify what others should handle
- **Saying no** by recognizing tasks that shouldn't be done at all
- **Breaking reactive cycles** when you're always firefighting

## Methodology Foundation

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Source** | Dwight D. Eisenhower (1890-1969), 34th US President, Supreme Allied Commander |
| **Expert** | Eisenhower managed WWII logistics and two presidential terms using this mental model |
| **Core Principle** | Separate the truly important from the merely urgent. Most people confuse the two and spend their lives on urgent-but-unimportant tasks. |


## What Claude Does vs What You Decide

| Claude Does | You Decide |
|-------------|------------|
| Structures content frameworks | Final messaging |
| Suggests persuasion techniques | Brand voice |
| Creates draft variations | Version selection |
| Identifies optimization opportunities | Publication timing |
| Analyzes competitor approaches | Strategic direction |

## What This Skill Does

1. **Separates important from urgent** - Reveals what actually deserves your time
2. **Identifies what to delegate** - Finds tasks others should handle
3. **Exposes time-wasters** - Shows what should be eliminated entirely
4. **Protects deep work** - Creates space for important-but-not-urgent work
5. **Reduces stress** - Provides clarity in chaos

## How to Use

### Categorize Your Tasks
```
Apply the Eisenhower Matrix to these tasks:
[list your tasks]

Sort them into the four quadrants and recommend next actions.
```

### Plan Your Week
```
Help me plan my week using the Eisenhower Matrix.
Here's everything on my plate:
[list tasks, projects, meetings]

What should I focus on? What should I delegate or eliminate?
```

### Break a Reactive Cycle
```
I spend most of my time firefighting. Apply Eisenhower Matrix thinking to help me:
[describe your situation]

How do I shift from urgent to important?
```

## Instructions

When applying the Eisenhower Matrix, follow this systematic process:

### Step 1: Understand the Matrix

### Step 2: Define Important vs. Urgent

```
## Definitions

### URGENT
- Demands immediate attention
- Puts you in reactive mode
- Often visible and pressing
- Usually tied to someone else's priorities

**Test:** "If I don't do this TODAY, what happens?"

### IMPORTANT
- Contributes to your mission, values, long-term goals
- Requires initiative and proactivity
- Often invisible until it becomes urgent
- Usually tied to YOUR priorities

**Test:** "Does this move me toward my most important goals?"

## The Trap

Most people spend 90% of time in Q1 and Q3.
The highest performers spend significant time in Q2.

Q2 is where life-changing work happens:
- Building skills before you need them
- Maintaining relationships before they break
- Planning before crisis hits
- Exercising before health fails
```

---

### Step 3: Sort Your Tasks

```
## Task Sorting Process

For each task, ask two questions:

1. "Is this URGENT?" (Needs action within 24-48 hours?)
   □ Yes → Left column (Q1 or Q3)
   □ No → Right column (Q2 or Q4)

2. "Is this IMPORTANT?" (Moves me toward goals? High impact?)
   □ Yes → Top row (Q1 or Q2)
   □ No → Bottom row (Q3 or Q4)

## Sorting Matrix

| Task | Urgent? | Important? | Quadrant |
|------|---------|------------|----------|
| [Task 1] | Y/N | Y/N | Q__ |
| [Task 2] | Y/N | Y/N | Q__ |
| [Task 3] | Y/N | Y/N | Q__ |
```

---

### Step 4: Apply Quadrant-Specific Actions

```
## QUADRANT 1: DO FIRST 🔥
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**Action:** Handle these immediately.

**Tasks in Q1:**
- [ ] ___________________ (Deadline: ___)
- [ ] ___________________ (Deadline: ___)

**Warning:** If everything is Q1, you're always firefighting.
Ask: "How did this become urgent? Could I have prevented it?"

**Goal:** Minimize Q1 through better Q2 work.

---

## QUADRANT 2: SCHEDULE 📅
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**Action:** Block time in your calendar NOW.

**Tasks in Q2:**
- [ ] ___________________ (Scheduled: ___)
- [ ] ___________________ (Scheduled: ___)

**This is THE critical quadrant.**

Examples:
- Strategic planning
- Building relationships
- Learning new skills
- Exercise and health
- Writing the book
- Preparing before deadlines

**Rule:** If it doesn't get scheduled, it doesn't happen.

---

## QUADRANT 3: DELEGATE 👥
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**Action:** Give to someone else (or say no).

**Tasks in Q3:**
- [ ] ___________________ (Delegate to: ___)
- [ ] ___________________ (Delegate to: ___)

**Questions:**
- Who else could do this?
- Does this REALLY need to be done?
- Is this someone else's priority disguised as mine?

**Delegation options:**
- Team member
- Virtual assistant
- Automated system
- Just say no

---

## QUADRANT 4: ELIMINATE 🗑️
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

**Action:** Stop doing these. Full stop.

**Tasks in Q4:**
- [x] ___________________ (Eliminated)
- [x] ___________________ (Eliminated)

**Common Q4 activities:**
- Mindless scrolling
- Unnecessary meetings
- Busy work that feels productive
- "Just checking" email loops
- Perfectionism on low-value tasks

**Test:** "If I stopped doing this, would anyone notice?"
```

---

### Step 5: Weekly Review Ritual

```
## Weekly Eisenhower Review

**Every Sunday (30 minutes):**

### 1. REVIEW LAST WEEK
- How much time did I spend in each quadrant?
- What Q1 items could have been prevented?
- Did I protect my Q2 time?

### 2. BRAIN DUMP
List everything on your mind for the week:
-
-
-
-
-

### 3. SORT INTO QUADRANTS
[Use the matrix from Step 3]

### 4. SCHEDULE Q2 FIRST
Block Q2 activities BEFORE anything else:
- Monday: ___________________
- Tuesday: ___________________
- Wednesday: ___________________
- Thursday: ___________________
- Friday: ___________________

### 5. DECIDE ON Q1
What truly urgent items need attention?
- Day 1: ___________________
- Day 2: ___________________

### 6. DELEGATE Q3
Who will handle these?
-
-

### 7. ELIMINATE Q4
What will I NOT do this week?
-
-
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Executive Weekly Planning

**Context:** CEO with packed calendar wants to reclaim strategic thinking time.

**Input:**
> "Here's my task list for next week. Apply Eisenhower Matrix:
> - Board presentation (due Friday)
> - Review Q2 strategy
> - 12 internal meetings
> - Answer 50+ emails
> - Recruit VP Sales
> - Update investors
> - Performance review prep
> - Networking dinner Thursday
> - Exercise
> - Team birthday celebration"

**Output:**

**Sorted Matrix:**

| Task | Quadrant | Action |
|------|----------|--------|
| Board presentation | Q1 | DO - Must finish by Friday |
| Update investors | Q1 | DO - Time-sensitive communication |
| Review Q2 strategy | Q2 | SCHEDULE - Block Tuesday AM |
| Recruit VP Sales | Q2 | SCHEDULE - Critical hire, not urgent |
| Exercise | Q2 | SCHEDULE - Daily 30 min, non-negotiable |
| Performance review prep | Q2 | SCHEDULE - Prepare this week, due next |
| 12 internal meetings | Q3 | DELEGATE/DECLINE - Review each. Cancel 6, delegate 3 |
| Answer 50+ emails | Q3 | DELEGATE - Have EA handle 80%, batch 20% |
| Networking dinner | Q3 | ATTEND - But leave early if needed |
| Team birthday | Q4 | ELIMINATE - Send card, skip event |

**Recommended Week:**

```
MONDAY
├── 8:00-11:00: Board presentation work (Q1)
├── 11:00-12:00: Exercise (Q2)
├── 2:00-4:00: Board presentation finalize (Q1)
└── 4:00-5:00: Critical emails only (Q3)

TUESDAY
├── 8:00-12:00: Q2 Strategy deep work (Q2) 🔒
├── 1:00-2:00: VP Sales interviews (Q2)
└── 3:00-5:00: Investor update calls (Q1)

WEDNESDAY
├── 8:00-9:00: Exercise (Q2)
├── 9:00-11:00: Performance review prep (Q2)
├── 1:00-3:00: 3 essential meetings only (Q1/Q2)
└── 3:00-5:00: VP Sales process (Q2)

THURSDAY
├── 8:00-10:00: Final board prep (Q1)
├── 10:00-12:00: Strategic thinking (Q2)
├── 6:00-8:00: Networking dinner (Q3)

FRIDAY
├── 10:00-12:00: Board presentation (Q1)
├── 1:00-3:00: Week review + next week planning (Q2)
```

**Key Insight:** By cutting 6 meetings and delegating email, you recovered 15+ hours. Most goes to Q2 (strategy, hiring, preparation).

---

### Example 2: Startup Founder Triage

**Context:** Founder is drowning in tasks, hasn't done strategic work in weeks.

**Input:**
> "I'm completely reactive. Here's my chaos:
> - Customer fire (data issue)
> - Investor meeting tomorrow
> - Hire 2 engineers (posting live, no interviews)
> - Website bugs
> - Sales calls
> - Team 1:1s
> - Cash flow planning
> - Content marketing
> - Product roadmap
> - Technical debt
> - Support tickets"

**Output:**

**The Problem:** Everything feels Q1 because you're behind on Q2.

**Emergency Triage:**

| Task | TRUE Quadrant | Action |
|------|---------------|--------|
| Customer fire | Q1 | DO NOW - Then create prevention system (Q2) |
| Investor meeting | Q1 | DO - Prep tonight |
| Cash flow planning | Q1 | DO - This determines survival |
| Website bugs | Q3 | DELEGATE - Hire contractor or offshore |
| Support tickets | Q3 | DELEGATE - Hire support person or use AI |
| Sales calls | Q2/Q3 | DELEGATE eventually - You do for now, document process |
| Hire engineers | Q2 | SCHEDULE - Block 2 hours daily for recruiting |
| Team 1:1s | Q2 | SCHEDULE - 30 min each, don't skip |
| Product roadmap | Q2 | SCHEDULE - Needs 4-hour block |
| Content marketing | Q4 | ELIMINATE for now - Not survival-critical |
| Technical debt | Q4 | ELIMINATE for now - Only fix if blocking |

**The Shift You Need:**

BEFORE (Reactive):
- 80% Q1/Q3 (fires and interruptions)
- 20% Q2 (when you can squeeze it in)

AFTER (Strategic):
- 40% Q1 (real fires only)
- 40% Q2 (scheduled, protected)
- 20% Q3 (delegated where possible)

**This Week's Focus:**
1. Resolve customer fire + build alert system (prevent future Q1)
2. Nail investor meeting
3. Block 2 hours daily for engineer recruiting
4. Delegate support (even temporary solution)

**Q2 Non-Negotiables to Schedule:**
- Wednesday 8-12: Product roadmap
- Daily 30 min: Engineer recruiting
- Thursday: Cash flow model

### Q1 Overload (Always Firefighting)
- [ ] Every day has multiple "emergencies"
- [ ] You can't remember your last proactive day
- [ ] Weekends are for catching up
- [ ] You're exhausted but feel unproductive

**Fix:** Ask "How do I prevent this from recurring?"

### Q3 Trap (Everyone Else's Priorities)
- [ ] Calendar is full but nothing strategic gets done
- [ ] You say yes to everything
- [ ] Other people's "urgent" drives your day
- [ ] You feel busy but not effective

**Fix:** Start saying no. Delegate ruthlessly.

### Q2 Drought (No Strategic Work)
- [ ] Can't remember last time you did deep work
- [ ] Important things keep getting "pushed"
- [ ] You feel like you're drifting
- [ ] No progress on long-term goals

**Fix:** Schedule Q2 first. Treat it as sacred.

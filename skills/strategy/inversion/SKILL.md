# Inversion

> "Invert, always invert." Apply Carl Jacobi's mathematical principle and Charlie Munger's investing wisdom to solve problems by thinking backward from failure.

## When to Use This Skill

- **Goal setting** - Define what would guarantee failure, then avoid it
- **Risk analysis** - Identify what could destroy your project before starting
- **Decision making** - Evaluate choices by examining their worst outcomes
- **Problem solving** - When direct approaches aren't working, reverse the question
- **Strategy development** - Find competitive advantages by avoiding common mistakes
- **Personal development** - Identify habits and behaviors that guarantee failure

## Methodology Foundation

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Source** | Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi (1804-1851), mathematician; Charlie Munger, investor |
| **Expert** | Munger credits Jacobi: "Invert, always invert" (from "man muss immer umkehren") |
| **Core Principle** | Many problems are best solved backward. Instead of asking "How do I succeed?", ask "What would guarantee failure?" then avoid those things. |


## What Claude Does vs What You Decide

| Claude Does | You Decide |
|-------------|------------|
| Structures content frameworks | Final messaging |
| Suggests persuasion techniques | Brand voice |
| Creates draft variations | Version selection |
| Identifies optimization opportunities | Publication timing |
| Analyzes competitor approaches | Strategic direction |

## What This Skill Does

1. **Reveals hidden risks** - Surfaces dangers invisible when thinking forward
2. **Simplifies complex problems** - Failure paths are often clearer than success paths
3. **Prevents catastrophic mistakes** - Avoidance is easier than achievement
4. **Improves decision quality** - Forces consideration of downside scenarios
5. **Unlocks creative solutions** - Reverse framing reveals new approaches

## How to Use

### Invert a Goal
```
Apply Inversion to this goal:
[describe your goal]

What would GUARANTEE failure? What should I avoid at all costs?
```

### Analyze a Decision
```
Use Inversion to evaluate this decision:
[describe the choice you're facing]

If I wanted this to fail spectacularly, what would I do?
```

### Improve a Strategy
```
Invert this strategy to find weaknesses:
[describe your plan]

How could a competitor or circumstances destroy this plan?
```

## Instructions

When applying Inversion, follow this systematic process:

### Step 1: State the Problem or Goal Clearly

```
## Forward Statement

**What I want to achieve:**
[Clear, specific goal]

**Current approach:**
[How I'm thinking about solving it]

**Why direct approach may be insufficient:**
[Complexity, uncertainty, blind spots]
```

---

### Step 2: Invert the Question

```
## The Inversion

**Original Question:**
"How do I [achieve goal]?"

**Inverted Question:**
"How do I GUARANTEE [failure/opposite of goal]?"

**Reframe:**
Instead of: "How do I build a successful company?"
Ask: "How do I guarantee my company fails?"

Instead of: "How do I have a happy marriage?"
Ask: "How do I guarantee divorce?"

Instead of: "How do I get healthy?"
Ask: "How do I guarantee I stay unhealthy?"
```

**Munger's Insight:**
"It is remarkable how much long-term advantage people like us have gotten by trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be very intelligent."

---

### Step 3: List All Ways to Guarantee Failure

```
## Failure Recipe

**If I wanted to GUARANTEE failure, I would:**

1. [Action/behavior that ensures failure]
2. [Action/behavior that ensures failure]
3. [Action/behavior that ensures failure]
4. [Action/behavior that ensures failure]
5. [Action/behavior that ensures failure]

**Attitudes that guarantee failure:**
-
-
-

**Decisions that guarantee failure:**
-
-
-

**Habits that guarantee failure:**
-
-
-
```

**Be Thorough:** Generate at least 10-15 failure paths. The most obvious ones come first, but the subtle ones are often more dangerous.

---

### Step 4: Invert Back to Success Principles

```
## Inversion to Success

| Guaranteed Failure | Therefore, I Must... |
|--------------------|---------------------|
| [Failure action 1] | [Avoid/do opposite] |
| [Failure action 2] | [Avoid/do opposite] |
| [Failure action 3] | [Avoid/do opposite] |

**Key Avoidances (Non-Negotiable):**
1. Never [failure behavior]
2. Never [failure behavior]
3. Never [failure behavior]

**Required Actions (Derived from Inversion):**
1. Always [opposite of failure]
2. Always [opposite of failure]
3. Always [opposite of failure]
```

---

### Step 5: Create Anti-Goals

```
## Anti-Goals

**Definition:** Things I commit to NEVER doing, regardless of circumstances.

### My Anti-Goals:

1. **I will NEVER:** [specific anti-goal]
   **Because it guarantees:** [failure outcome]

2. **I will NEVER:** [specific anti-goal]
   **Because it guarantees:** [failure outcome]

3. **I will NEVER:** [specific anti-goal]
   **Because it guarantees:** [failure outcome]

### Tripwires (Early Warning Signs)

If I notice any of these, STOP and reassess:
- [Warning sign that I'm heading toward failure]
- [Warning sign that I'm heading toward failure]
- [Warning sign that I'm heading toward failure]
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Startup Success via Inversion

**Context:** Founder wants to build a successful startup.

**Input:**
> "I want to build a successful startup. Apply Inversion - what would guarantee failure?"

**Output:**

**Forward Statement:**
- Goal: Build a successful, sustainable startup
- Current approach: Find product-market fit, raise funding, scale

**The Inversion:**

"How do I GUARANTEE my startup fails?"

**Failure Recipe - Top 15 Ways to Kill a Startup:**

1. **Build something nobody wants** - Skip customer research, build based on assumptions
2. **Run out of money** - Burn fast, raise slow, no runway management
3. **Co-founder conflict** - Don't align on vision, equity, roles upfront
4. **Ignore unit economics** - Grow revenue while losing money per customer
5. **Hire too fast** - Add headcount before product-market fit
6. **Hire too slow** - Miss market window by being understaffed
7. **Pivot too often** - Never give an idea enough time
8. **Never pivot** - Stick with failing approach out of stubbornness
9. **Ignore competition** - Assume you're the only one with this idea
10. **Obsess over competition** - Copy instead of innovate
11. **Poor communication with investors** - Surprise them with bad news
12. **Single point of failure** - One key customer, one key employee, one key feature
13. **Technical debt mountain** - Ship fast forever, never refactor
14. **Premature scaling** - Spend on growth before product works
15. **Founder burnout** - Work 100-hour weeks indefinitely

**Inversion to Success:**

| Guaranteed Failure | Therefore, I Must... |
|--------------------|---------------------|
| Build without customer input | Talk to 50+ customers before building |
| Run out of money | Always maintain 18+ months runway |
| Co-founder misalignment | Have explicit co-founder agreement before starting |
| Ignore unit economics | Know CAC, LTV, payback from day 1 |
| Premature scaling | Only scale after clear product-market fit signals |

**Anti-Goals for This Startup:**

1. **NEVER** raise money we don't need
2. **NEVER** hire ahead of revenue
3. **NEVER** surprise investors with bad news
4. **NEVER** ignore customer churn signals
5. **NEVER** work more than 60 hours/week consistently

**Why This Works:** Instead of chasing "success tactics," we've identified the landmines. Avoiding these gives us a massive advantage over founders who hit them.

### Example 2: Career Advancement via Inversion

**Context:** Professional wants to advance their career over the next 5 years.

**Input:**
> "I want to advance my career. What would guarantee I stay stuck?"

**Output:**

**The Inversion:**

"How do I GUARANTEE career stagnation?"

**Failure Recipe - 12 Ways to Kill Your Career:**

1. **Stop learning** - Assume your current skills are enough forever
2. **Avoid hard problems** - Only take safe, easy assignments
3. **Never take credit** - Let others claim your work
4. **Take all credit** - Never acknowledge team contributions
5. **Burn bridges** - Treat people badly when you have leverage
6. **Stay invisible** - Never speak up, never present, never write
7. **Ignore feedback** - Dismiss criticism as jealousy or misunderstanding
8. **Only work IN the business** - Never work ON your career
9. **Rely on one sponsor** - When they leave, you're orphaned
10. **Avoid difficult conversations** - Let resentments build
11. **Be the expert in a dying field** - Double down on obsolete skills
12. **Complain without solutions** - Be known as the negative one

**Inversion to Success:**

| Guaranteed Stagnation | Therefore, I Must... |
|-----------------------|---------------------|
| Stop learning | Dedicate 5 hours/week to skill development |
| Avoid hard problems | Volunteer for one stretch assignment per year |
| Stay invisible | Publish/present at least quarterly |
| Rely on one sponsor | Cultivate 3-5 relationships with senior people |
| Ignore feedback | Actively seek and act on feedback monthly |

**Anti-Goals for My Career:**

1. **NEVER** go a month without learning something new
2. **NEVER** let a year pass without a visible achievement
3. **NEVER** burn a bridge (even when justified)
4. **NEVER** become the expert in only one thing
5. **NEVER** complain without proposing a solution

**Tripwires:**
- If I haven't learned anything new in 30 days → reassess
- If I can't name 3 senior advocates → build relationships
- If I'm doing the same work as 2 years ago → seek stretch

### Inversion for Decisions

```
## Decision Inversion Template

**Decision:** Should I [option A] or [option B]?

### Invert Option A:
"If I choose A and it fails catastrophically, why?"
-
-
-

### Invert Option B:
"If I choose B and it fails catastrophically, why?"
-
-
-

### Comparison:
| Failure Mode | Option A Risk | Option B Risk |
|--------------|---------------|---------------|
| [Mode 1] | High/Med/Low | High/Med/Low |
| [Mode 2] | High/Med/Low | High/Med/Low |
| [Mode 3] | High/Med/Low | High/Med/Low |

**Insight from Inversion:**
[What did reverse thinking reveal?]

**Decision:**
[Which option has more avoidable failure modes?]

### Munger's Standard Inversion Questions

```
## Charlie Munger's Inversion Questions

Apply these to any goal or decision:

1. "What could cause this to fail completely?"

2. "What would a competitor do to destroy us?"

3. "What's the most likely way I'm wrong?"

4. "What would make me look back and say 'how did I miss that'?"

5. "If this failed, what would the post-mortem say?"

6. "What am I not seeing because I don't want to see it?"

7. "How would a smart, well-resourced enemy attack this?"

8. "What would I have to believe for this to fail?"
```

---

### Red Flags: When Inversion is Critical

```
## You MUST Apply Inversion When:

- [ ] Stakes are high (career, money, relationships)
- [ ] Decision is irreversible or hard to reverse
- [ ] You're feeling overconfident
- [ ] Everyone agrees (groupthink risk)
- [ ] You haven't considered failure modes
- [ ] The plan seems "foolproof"
- [ ] You're emotionally attached to the outcome

## Warning: Inversion Reveals Uncomfortable Truths

Be prepared to discover:
- Plans you love have fatal flaws
- "Sure things" aren't sure at all
- You've been avoiding obvious risks
- The easy path leads to failure
```

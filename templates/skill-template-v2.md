### Recommended Iteration Pattern

| Pass | Focus | Questions to Ask |
|------|-------|------------------|
| **1st** | Structure | "Does the framework capture the key elements?" |
| **2nd** | Accuracy | "Is the information accurate for MY context?" |
| **3rd** | Nuance | "Does it capture the subtleties of my brand/market?" |
| **4th** | Polish | "Is it ready for external use?" |

### Useful Follow-up Prompts

After the first output, try:
- "Make this more [specific/aggressive/conservative] because [context]"
- "The [section] doesn't capture [nuance]. Here's more context: [details]"
- "Compare this to [competitor/alternative] and strengthen the differentiation"
- "My audience would object that [objection]. Address this."

## Learning Curve

| Usage | What You'll Experience |
|-------|----------------------|
| **1st use** | Structured output, you discover the framework |
